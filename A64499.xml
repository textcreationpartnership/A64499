            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have, Courteous Reader, but two things to ſay to thee; the firſt is, To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Chymiſtry;</hi> and the other is, To ſet down my Way and Method of proceeding in Operations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> as I take it, is a <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Art,</hi> which, though it have the ſame Object, and the ſame End, as <hi>Vulgar Pharmacy,</hi> does nevertheleſs compoſe it by Nobler, and more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<pb facs="tcp:106227:4"/> Means, and more to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Phyſick. In ancient times, even long before <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Phyſitians neither knew, nor made uſe of any more than four ways of preparing their Remedies; for, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they preſſed the Juice out of their Ingredients, or beat them to powder, or they boiled them, or elſe they infuſed them in Water, or ſome other Liquor, and ſo gave them to their <hi>Patients.</hi> Some Ages after, and particularly ſince <hi>Meſue,</hi> and thoſe other famous <hi>Arabians,</hi> till the time of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> Phyſitians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually invented ſo many new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and put ſo many Diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon their Remedies, that they were fain to give over doing of it themſelves, and to aſſign that care to thoſe whom we now call <hi>Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> But, if we give a Judicious
<pb facs="tcp:106227:4"/> Curioſity leave to pry into theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Diſguiſes, we ſhall ſoon be convinced, that they are indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the four firſt Simple Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, with the addition of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or Honey, and ſome differences of Colour and Conſiſtency; for the moſt part heaping great quantities of Simples one upon another, to the end their <hi>Patients</hi> might ſwallow them with leſs diſtaſte. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his Followers having particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought upon Minerals, found out ſome excellent Remedies; and being encouraged by their rich Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, they continued them with ſuch eagerneſs, that in a ſhort time with Inventions equally ingenious and laborious, they did almoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the three Kingdoms of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Animals</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> and came to the poſſeſſion of moſt rich,
<pb facs="tcp:106227:5"/> and hitherto unknown Secrets, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as one may ſay, that even from the beginning of the World, to their times, the Vertues of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Remedies lay buried in their own Bodies, as in a Grave. This may be clearly ſeen in Crude <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> of which a pound, either in powder, or in Infuſion, or Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, works no other effect in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than if we had ſwallowed as much Saw-duſt. But, if you know how to open its Body by the Keys of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> then for interiour Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, you ſhall have an <hi>Emetick,</hi> a <hi>Purgative,</hi> a <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> a <hi>Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> a <hi>Diuretick,</hi> and a Cordial, which you need only give in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent proportion of ſo many Grains. And for exteriour Applications, you may, out of the ſame <hi>Antimony,</hi> have a <hi>Deſiccative,</hi> a <hi>Mundificative,</hi> a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106227:5"/> or <hi>Eſcarotick,</hi> with other rare Remedies, as we ſhall hereafter ſet down at large. If we conſider <hi>Mercury,</hi> they that work in the Mines in <hi>Spain,</hi> teach us by their Theft, that more than a pound of it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwards without harm; for, a little before they give over working, they ſwallow a good quantity of it, which, when they are at liberty, they eaſe themſelves of by Stool, and ſo keep it to ſell in ſecret. And this the Overſeers having diſcovered, do now force every Workman to ſtay there a conſiderable time, after his giving over working, that theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Thieves may be ſo forced to leave their theft behind them. But, if by the vertue of Chymical Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants you open the body of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, it will produce in very ſmall Doſes, ſuch various and wonderful
<pb facs="tcp:106227:6"/> effects, that out of it alone may be had Remedies to anſwer all the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Phyſick. Is there any thing more contemptible than <hi>Niter,</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Vulgar Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</hi> But, is there any thing more admirable than the ſelf-ſame <hi>Niter</hi> handled by <hi>Chymiſtry?</hi> for with it, we make now a pleaſant and cooling <hi>Acid,</hi> now a hot and burning <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;</hi> ſometimes it revives the <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Purgative</hi> vertue of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> ſometimes it kills the <hi>Emetick,</hi> and revives only the <hi>Purgative,</hi> and ſometimes it deſtroys both <hi>Emetick</hi> and <hi>Purgative,</hi> and quickens either the <hi>Diuretick</hi> or <hi>Diaphoretick;</hi> and in a word, it produces ſo many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects upon all the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, that we may juſtly call it the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Agent</hi> of <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> Who would think that a quantity of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106227:6"/> no bigger than a Pea, Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally prepared, were able to heal, by once touching, any Ulcers of the Mouth? and by two or three touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſoften and heal the hardeſt, and moſt inveterate Ulcers, and even the Gangrene it ſelf in any part of the Body, and that incomparably better than any Remedy of the Old <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi> Would any body believe, that out of <hi>Common Salt,</hi> which is generally reputed ſo prejudicial to thoſe that are ſubject to the Stone or Gravel, Chymiſts ſhould extract a pleaſant Spirit, which drives out all Gravel, breaks the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bladder, and diſſolves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the palm of the hand a Stone cut out of a humane Bladder?</p>
            <p>I ſhould be tedious in ſetting out all the other VVonders of this Art, only this I'll ſay to prove its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
<pb facs="tcp:106227:7"/> That whereas in its birth, and even in its growth, when it was either not known at all, or ill known by Phyſitians, almoſt every body had an averſion, and a prejudice againſt it; now quite contrary, being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, and throughly known by the Learned and Experienced Profeſſors of this Art, it has gained the Reputation of being the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the excellent Cures they perform.</p>
            <p>But, if in requital of the kind Reception it now meets withal in the world, <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> hath any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to pay, it is particularly to <hi>Monſieur Vallot,</hi> who having been long the Phyſitian of the greateſt Practice in <hi>Paris,</hi> is now the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty;</hi> in which place, by his profound Learning, and the excellent choice
<pb facs="tcp:106227:7"/> of Remedies, borrowed, for the moſt part, from <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> he ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms wonderful, and moſt ſingular Cures. So famous an Example makes me apt to believe, that if there be any perſons obſtinate in their old errour againſt <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> they will by little and little forſake it; as thoſe have been forced to do, who for a long time ſtubbornly oppoſed the new Diſcovery of the Veſſels that carry the Chyle from the Stomach to the Heart, without coming at the Liver, only becauſe they had not ſeen, or at leaſt not well obſerved this new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</p>
            <p>Now for my Method, it all runs upon two principles; <hi>Firſt,</hi> To find out, and ſet down ſolid and pertinent Reaſons of all the Circumſtances which accompany our Operations. The <hi>Second,</hi> to diſcover the beſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt,
<pb facs="tcp:106227:8"/> and ſhorteſt way of performing the ſaid Operations. Theſe were no eaſie things to be found out; for, the firſt Chymiſts happened upon abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent Secrets, but being ignorant of the true Reaſons of their Diſcovery; that they might give credit to their new Science, they made uſe of the Cabaliſtique Cloak, of covering all things with a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Modern Profeſſors indeed have given a better Foundation to their Art, and ſo good an one, as hath ſhaken that of the old Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, but withal, either for want of skill, or maliciouſly they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred their proceſſes with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſuch impertinent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, lengthening both them and the expences, that very few, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none, but very ſharp-ſighted Phyſitians have been able to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:106227:8"/> through the Cloud, and both receive and communicate the benefit of the light there hidden. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration has moved me in this my VVork, to keep within the limits of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> neglecting any Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſide my purpoſe; and withal, to endeavour to free my proceſſes from all thoſe Obſcurities, Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Protractions, which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Reaſon have convinced me to be either ſuperfluous, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to them. If I have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted my deſign to thy mind, I muſt confeſs, Courteous Reader, that it is much a harder thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form well, than to project.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106227:18"/> that do happen, and which ſometimes, in ſome choice and important Operations, ought to be obſerved with a great deal of care, that one may either augment or diminiſh the heat, as neceſſity ſhall require. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The place ought to be ſo capacious, as that in one part may be the Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in another the Veſſels and Utenſils, and in another your Auditors or Spectators; and yet in the middle there may be room enough left for the Artiſt to mind his Operations, and beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Chymical Inſtruments.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Chymical Inſtruments,</hi> with which a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory ought to be furniſhed, are of two ſorts: for ſome are <hi>Principal,</hi> the others <hi>leſs-Principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Principal</hi> Inſtruments without which no Operation can be done, are, the <hi>Lute,</hi> the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi> the <hi>Veſſels,</hi> and the <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>leſs-Principal</hi> are thoſe that ſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for one Proceſs, ſometimes for another, towards the facilitating of them; and are in great number. But I propoſe only <hi>Thirty</hi> of the moſt uſeful: <hi>viz.</hi> an Iron Ladle, a little Iron Bar, an Iron Spatula, a great Stick, a Braſs Mortar and Peſtle, a Marble Mortar, with a Woodden-peſtle; a Plate-diſh of White-ware, with a Glaſs-peſtle, two pair of Scales and Weights; a Marble or Porphyry-ſtone to grind
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106227:18"/> upon; ſome Pack-thread, white and brown Paper, Starch or Glue, a fine Sieve; ſome old Linen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rags cut out into long ſlices, ſome Aſhes, ſome Sand, ſome Tiles, ſome water, a Tin-Mould in form of a Pipe, an Iron-Mould for Piſtol-Bullets, a Copper-Mould for a Goblet, a little Trevet, a Woodden Spoon, a Tin-Tunnel, Rolls ſtuft with Straw or Chaff, or made of Paſte-board, a Mould for Bricks, a Fire-Shovel, a pair of Tongs, and a pair of Bellows. Of theſe we ſhall not treat here particularly, but as occaſion ſhall ſerve in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations where they ſhall be imployed.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Chymical Lute.</head>
               <p>TO make a good Lute for all the purpoſes of Chymiſtry, take of Potters-Earth, of white or yellow Sand, and of Horſe-dung, an equal quantity, not an equal weight; mingle them, and moiſten them by little and little with water, firſt working them together with your feet upon the ground, then piece by piece kneading of them exactly with your hands upon a Table, till you have ſo incorporated your Ingredients, that they are not diſtinguiſhable from one another; then make them up in form of Bricks, that ſo you may uſe them more neatly; keeping them from Fire and Sun, leſt they ſhould be over-dry and hard. The Potters Earth is made uſe of becauſe of its unctuoſity, which makes the Lute leſs brittle; the Sand is employed to bind the Potters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106227:19"/> Earth from cracking, and flying, and burning to duſt. (And ſome do uſe powder'd Glaſs for the ſame end.) The Horſe-dung is added, becauſe being full of little Straws well grownd by the Horſes Teeth, they do ſerve for the firmer knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the matter together. (And ſo ſome uſe Calves Hair for that purpoſe.) Finally, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incorporates theſe three things together; In the place of which, ſome uſe the Whites of Eggs, which by their ſlimineſs make a ſtronger conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination of all the Ingredients.</p>
               <p>This Lute ſerves for ſix uſes: 1. To make Bricks. 2. To lute and cement the Bricks of your Furnaces. 3. To fill up the cracks and ſlits of your Furnaces. 4. To frame little Rounds like Salt-ſellers to ſet the Retorts on. 5. To lute all Veſſels both of Earth and Glaſs. 6. To repair the cracks of your Veſſels. Now becauſe there is a peculiar induſtry in well forming the Bricks and Salt-ſellers, or Rounds, and in luting the Veſſels; I ſhall here ſet it down at length.</p>
               <p>Our Bricks are all of a bigneſs and proportion, that ſo our Furnaces may be the more even and firm, and the eaſilier built, even without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Moreover, they are almoſt in the ſhape of a half Moon, that they may make the Furnace round; that figure being the fitteſt to gather and concentrate the heat. Therefore we form our Bricks in a Woodden-mould either of Box or Guaiac, or ſome ſuch hard wood. The piece of wood is a foot long, half a foot broad, and three inches thick. In its middle there muſt be a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or overture drawn from a Round made with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106227:19"/> a Compaſs; which Overture ought to be eight inches outwards, ſix inches inwards; three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches large, and three inches thick. Now to make your Bricks, fill your mould with lute, and with a woodden knife even the ſuperficies, and ſo knock out your Brick; and when your mould grows dirty, rub the ſides of it with ſand; dry your Bricks in the ſhade, ſo they will laſt longer; for being thus half-dried, they will bake leaſurely in the uſing of them, and not be apt to crumble and break, neither will they be ſo ſoon calcin'd, as if you had dried them by the fire or Sun, or in a Potters Oven.</p>
               <p>Our Rounds or Salt-ſellers derive their name from their figure, becauſe they are ſomewhat like the old-faſhioned Salt-ſellers. To form them, take of our Lute a quantity as big as your fiſt, and rowling it between both hands, reduce it to the form of a Cylinder two inches high; flat the lower end of it upon a Table, and then with your fingers ſink in the upper part, till it be ſomewhat like a Salt-ſeller that is hollow, and of the breadth of an inch in diameter.</p>
               <p>For the luting of your Veſſels, the Lute that is employed ought to be ſofter than either for Bricks or Rounds, and therefore you'll do well to wet it with ſome Water. It muſt not be laid on thicker than the thickneſs of a Half-Crown-piece; for if it be, the fire will ſcarce be able to heat the Water contained in your Veſſels. Obſerve that ſometimes the Matraſſes are luted up to the neck, ſometimes half way. Retorts are luted in the ſame way too; only there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106227:20"/> ought to be a little ſpace left near the neck, that one may ſee thorow it into the Veſſel in the time of the Operation: Your Veſſel being luted, muſt be dried at leiſure in the Sun or ſhade, or near a gentle fire; taking care to turn them equally, ſo that they be not dried more in one place than in another.</p>

               <head>Of the Chymical Furnaces.</head>
               <p>OUr <hi>Furnaces</hi> are round and little: They are round, that they may unite and concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the heat of the fire; they are little, that our Laboratory may not be incumber'd to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and alſo that we may give our Veſſels a quicker and more equal fire, and that with leſs toil and leſs expence.</p>
               <p>We have two ſorts of Furnaces: the firſt are fixt, which are made of different lays of crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bricks, cemented ſtrongly together with our Lute; the others are moveable, and conſiſt of crooked Bricks laid one upon another without any lute or cement, and in which you lay the fire, not under your Veſſels as in the firſt ſort of Furnaces, but circularly round about them.</p>
               <p>The fixt and cemented Furnaces are <hi>five</hi> in number; to wit, the Furnace with a heat of <hi>Bulneum maris,</hi> or of the vaporous Bath; the Furnace with the heat of aſhes or ſand; the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with a naked fire and circular heat; the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106227:20"/> with a naked fire and ſmall Reverberation; and the Furnace with the fire of great Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The moveable and not cemented Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces are likewiſe <hi>five</hi> in number; <hi>viz.</hi> the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with a ſmall circulatory fire; the Furnace with a great circulatory fire; the Furnace with a fire of circulation and ſuppreſſion without a gape; the Furnace with a fire of circulation and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion with a gape; and the Furnace with a moulting fire, or the wind furnace: All theſe five Furnaces are with a naked fire.</p>
               <p>The Furnace with the heat of <hi>Balneum maris,</hi> or the vaporous Bath, is neceſſary for the gentle diſtilling of all ſorts of aery or ſulphureous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in glaſs-bodies, placed in a Cauldron full of water; and withal, it ſerves to evaporate and dry, by its gentle heating vapour, all extracts, and ſalts, in little earthen glaz'd diſhes, which are ſet upon the Overtures made in the cover of the ſaid Kettle or Cauldron; ſo that the remedies thus dryed have no odour not taſte of Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reume or burning.</p>
               <p>For the building of this Furnace, do thus: lay one Round of our Bricks of ſuch a compaſs as may be proportionate to the greatneſs of the Kettle you intend for your <hi>Balneum,</hi> leaving an empty place before, four or five inches broad for the aſhes-hole; then lay another entire Round of Bricks, upon which place your Grate; then upon this lay two Rounds more, leaving before an empty ſpace for your fire-door, as you did for your aſh-hole; and then add four entire Rounds for your Laboratory, leaving in the upper moſt of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106227:21"/> them three little jams or gaps, each an inch wide to let in the air; <hi>viz.</hi> one before, above the fire-door; another behind, over againſt to this firſt; and a third on the ſide, which ſhall be oppoſite to that where the Receiver is placed, leſt if there were one on that ſide, the flame might ſometimes break the Noſe of the Limbeck.</p>
               <p>Now for your Kettle or Cauldron, it muſt have a brim of an inch broad, whereby it may be ſcituated and equally ſuſpended upon the brims of your Furnace, leaving betwixt it and the Furnace-ſides an orbicular ſpace of an inch, to give the fire play round about it, that ſo it may heat equally the matter contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
               <p>In the Fabrick of this Furnace, as likewiſe in the ſtructure of the four following, obſerve:</p>
               <p>1. That you muſt not forget to put a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Lute under, above, and betwixt your Bricks, that they may be ſtrongly cemented together. 2. That you muſt not place your Bricks juſt one upon another; if ſo, your Furnace will not be firm and ſtable, but by the operation of the fire will ſoon cleave aſunder. Do therefore as expert Brick-layers, and interlace your Bricks one with another.</p>
               <p>The Furnace with the fire, or heat, or ſand, or aſhes, is uſeful for the diſtillation, and rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſorts of liquors drawn from Vegetals, Animals, or Minerals, in glaſs or earthen bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, glazed with their glaſs heads, and alſo for all infuſions, extinctions, tinctures, evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, &amp;c. made in Cucurbits, Matraſſes,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106227:21"/> diſhes, pans of glaſs, or glazed earthen ware.</p>
               <p>This is the hardeſt to be well built of all our Furnaces, and, for the building of it, do thus; firſt make a ſufficient quantity of Mortar, conſiſting of our Lute, Water, and Plaſter of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in powder; then with little Tiles make upon a floor, an Oval of one foot in length, and of eight inches in breadth; cement your Tiles well together with this Mortar, which becauſe of the Plaſter will render your Furnace more firm and durable; raiſe this firſt Oval Lay of Tiles to the heighth of two inches, leaving a ſpace for your aſh-hole; then add one Lay of our Bricks, not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the ſpace left for the aſh-hole, becauſe it muſt be almoſt as high as the ſpace to be left for the fire-room; upon this lay of Bricks, place your Iron-bars for a Grate in the ſame diſtance, as they are ſet in chafing-diſhes, placing one little bar upon the aſh-hole door, not forgetting to beſtow good ſtore of Mortar both above, under, and betwixt your Bricks and Bars: then upon ſo much of this Furnace as is already built, place ſmall Tiles, cementing of them together in ſuch an order, as may make this Furnace acquire a ſquare figure outwardly, which will make it more ſolid and firm; and by adding to it a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thickneſs, fit it for the conſerving of an equal heat with a few Coals. Upon this firſt lay of Bricks, (which have in the inſide an oval figure though the Tiles hanging over on the outſide form a ſquare one) place another Lay of Bricks, leaving a convenient ſpace for the fire-room, which muſt be ſomething higher than it is broad: but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106227:22"/> that in this Oval lay muſt be employed more Bricks than in the other, becauſe your Furnace by little and little muſt acquire a greater circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference towards the top; then build up with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tiles and Mortar, your ſquare outſide to the heighth of your Bricks, ſo continuing as you build up your Furnace: upon the top of the fire-room lay a little Iron bar, then add another entire round of Bricks without any overture, only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chinck in the backſide of your Furnace over againſt the fire-room, of two fingers breadth to give the fire air; and this Circle muſt be in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference wider by two inches than the laſt; ſmoothing with mortar the inſide of this round; that the fire may be carried more evenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: this done, place on this laſt Round a ſquare Iron plate all of a piece; (or of two pieces if you will, ſawdering them well one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the place muſt not be thicker than a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that ſo the fire may the eaſilier penetrate and give a moderate heat to the ſand; then with our Mortar raiſe on the inſide a Square of an inch thick, to all the four ſides of the Furnace, to make a place to put your ſand in, or aſhes if you will: aſhes give not ſo great a heat as ſand: whenſoever you deſire to moderate the heat of either, you may wet them with a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Furnace with a naked fire and circular heat, ſerves to diſtil <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> ſpirit of Wine, Aromatick and Balſamick oſſences, and alſo the waters of all Plants: in the Braſs-veſſel, called <hi>Veſica,</hi> with its Helm or Moors head, borded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106227:22"/> with a refrigeratory of the ſame metal, making uſe alſo of a long pipe of the ſame matter which paſſes through one or two great Hogs-heads full of water near the Furnace; and which are in ſtead of a ſecond and more powerful refrigeratory.</p>
               <p>For the building of this Furnace, do thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, take your Braſs Veſica, ſet it upon the ground where you intend to erect your Furnace, then lay a Round of Bricks well cemented with our Lute, ſo that there be half a fingers breadth left betwixt your Veſica and the Bricks, and an Overture for the aſh-hole; then taking out your Veſica, add another Round of Bricks, leaving ſtill room for the aſh-hole; which will be about half a foot high: upon theſe two lays place a Grate of divers little Iron-Bars; then add an entire Round of Bricks, to which add two more but not entire, leaving a ſpace empty for the fire-room perpendicularly over the aſh-hole; then add one circle of Bricks entire, without any Overture, upon which place two little Iron-Bars to uphold the bottom of your Veſica. And in this place is terminated the heighth of your fire-room, which is once again as high as your aſh-hole. After this raiſe by Rounds your Furnace, till you have brought it as high as the neck of the Veſica; which that you may the better do, place your Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica upon its two Bars, and ſo it will ſerve for a meaſure, to the elevation your Furnace ought to have.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, that this Furnace is not to have any chink on any ſide whatſoever; but every where, and particularly in the Laboratory, there ought
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106227:23"/> to be circularly half a fingers breadth left empty, that ſo the air compaſſing the Veſſel, may draw the heat upwards in all the circumference of the Veſica. And this environing heat carries the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from the bottom of the Veſſel to its neck, from whence they are raiſed all together to the top of the cover or Moors head; and if above you ſtop this empty circumference, your fire will be apt to go out, if it be not exceſſive great, which alſo would be inconvenient, becauſe it would conſume in vain great quantity of fewel.</p>
               <p>The Furnace with a naked fire and ſmall rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratory ſerves to diſtil the Phlegm, the Spirit, and the foetide Oyl of Berries, Woods, Barks, and Roots, in an earthen, or glaſs Retort well luted, leſt it ſhould break in the fire. For the building of this Furnace, you muſt firſt conſider of the bigneſs of the Retorts, you ordinarily intend to make uſe of; and make the circuit of your Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace ſo wide, as there may be a fingers breadth left betwixt it and your Retort. Lay then four or five Rounds of Bricks in the ſaid proportion, leaving an empty ſpace for your aſh-hole and fire-room; they being not to be ſeparated in this Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace by a Grate, becauſe elſe the air coming in at the aſh-hole, and meeting with the fire upon a Grate, would kindle it too violently, and ſo great a fire is not requiſite for theſe ſubſtances to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled. Then add an entire Round of Bricks, upon which place two Iron bars, upon which you muſt put the cover of a Pipkin turned with its hollow part upwards, which muſt be filled with ſand to receive the bottom of the Retort:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106227:23"/> then with divers Rounds of Brick raiſe your Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to the heighth of the Retort, or higher; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care to leave an overture, or open ſpace, to paſs the neck of the Retort; which chink you muſt afterwards with our Lute repair under the neck of your Retort, to hinder the flame from paſſing that way, and endangering the breaking of the Veſſels. Having fitted a Recipient to it, you muſt lute both their necks together, very cloſe, to the end that nothing of the ſpirits exhale and ſcape that way in the diſtillation. Laſt of all, you muſt have an earthen Pan of the capacity of your Furnace, which may cover the top of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberate the riſing flame upon the Retort; and this Pan muſt be of glazed earth, elſe it would fly in pieces in the heat: beſides, it muſt have a hole in the middle of its bottom, of the bigneſs of an Egg, and this to give the fire air, which elſe would be ſtifled, and go out.</p>
               <p>The Furnace with a naked fire, and great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory, ſerves to diſtil the acid and corroſive ſpirits; the acid, black and corroſive Oyls in a glaſs, or earthen luted Retort, or in an iron one. To build this Furnace, you muſt conſider of the bigneſs of the Retorts you mean to employ, and do as above in the little Reverberatory-Furnace: then make an aſh-hole covered with a Grate, and a fire-room covered with its two Iron bars; and at laſt, a Laboratory of the elevation of the belly of your Retort, as has been ſaid already; only you muſt on the top of the Laboratory leave a chink on one ſide of the aſh-hole, and fire-room, of two Bricks in heighth, to paſs the neck of the Retort.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106227:24"/> Before you place your Retort upon the Iron-Bars, you muſt provide a little earthen cover with aſhes, as has been ſaid in the firſt Furnace of this kind. Then place your Retort, and fit to it a large Recipient, which muſt be alſo ſetled with great care upon a little Joint-ſtool, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it muſt be either Paper, or Linen, or ſome ſoft thing, that it may reſt gently and ſurely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then with our Lute, fill up the ſpace you left for the neck of the Retort, for the reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the precedent Furnace, luting alſo the conjunction of the Retort and its Receiver toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: this being done, there remains to make a Reverberatory, which may reflect, and beat back the riſing heat, upon the Retort: and to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, lay five Rounds of moveable Bricks, that is, without Mortar, or Lute; only one upon another, in ſuch a manner as your Rounds go always in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing; ſo that in the firſt you employ half a Brick leſs than in the laſt cemented Round; and in the ſecond, a whole Brick leſs than in the firſt moveable Round; and in the third you muſt employ two Bricks leſs than in the ſecond, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a hole in this laſt Round, which you ſhall fill up with pieces of Iron, of ſuch a bigneſs as ſhall not ſlip betwixt the ſpace that is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Retort, and the Wall of the Furnace: The reaſon why I put Iron, rather than Bricks or Stone, or any other ſolid thing, is, becauſe at the end of the Operation you'll find an excellent <hi>Crocus aſtringens</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> red as Scarlet, and which will ſtick to the ſuperficies of all your pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iron.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106227:24"/>
               <p> The Furnace, with a little circulatory fire, or <hi>Ignis rotae parvus,</hi> ſerves to evaporate the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Minerals, as alſo of Animals and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, by a gentle ready heat in a Matraſs, either luted, or not luted. This Furnace is made of one only Round of our Bricks, cloſe ſet together without any Lute or Mortar: you muſt place a Round or Salt-ſeller of Lute in the middle of this Furnace; and upon this Salt-ſeller, filled with ſand or aſhes, place your Matraſs ſtraight, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a circumference of two inches between your Matraſs, and the Furnace ſides; then put your Coal, ready kindled, into this ſpace, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your fire nearer to the Furnace than to the Matraſs.</p>
               <p>The Furnace, with a great circulatory fire, ſerves to ſublime all ſalts drawn from Metals and Minerals in a luted glaſs Matraſs. This Furnace is made of two equal Rounds of our Bricks, ſo ſet together without Lute, that there is a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt them, to the end that the Air, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering at theſe ſmall Overtures, may ſerve to keep the fire alive: place your Salt-ſeller, and upon it your Matraſs, then your Coals, as we have ſaid in the precedent Furnace.</p>
               <p>The Furnace, with a circulary fire, and of ſuppreſſion without any chink; is uſeful to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and melt down all ſorts of Minerals, as alſo thoſe Animals and Vegetables that require Calcination, either in a Crucible, or a Pot of Earth unglazed: To build this Furnace, lay firſt upon the ground either a large Salt-ſeller of our Lute, or two Bricks, and upon them your
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106227:25"/> Crucible or Pot; then raiſe divers Rounds of our Bricks without Lute, till they come two or three fingers above your Pot, leaving in the firſt rank an interval of a fingers breadth betwixt the Bricks, but in the laſt <hi>row</hi> they muſt be joined very cloſe together: leave alſo betwixt your Crucible, and the Furnace-ſides, a ſpace of two inches broad, which muſt be filled with Coals up to the top of the Furnace: and from thence this fire is called a fire of Suppreſſion, becauſe the Coals are not only under, but circularly above, and on the ſides of the Veſſel; and beſides, very often we cover the whole Pot with Coals.</p>
               <p>The Furnace, with a fire of Suppreſſion, with a chink, is for the diſtillation of Oyls, and Spirits, and Phlegms of all ſorts of reſinous Gums, and Wax, in a Glaſs Retort well luted; it is made as the precedent, only there ought to be in the two laſt Rounds of Bricks, a chink, gap, or overture for the neck of your Retort to paſs through, which muſt be ſet, and compaſſed with Coals, as has been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, That in placing your Retort, either in this Furnace, or any of the ſmall or great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatories, there are three things to be taken notice of. 1. That the body of the Retort touch the Bricks of the ſide, that the Chink is in ſuch a manner as the whole neck may hang out at the Chink, leſt otherwiſe the fire ſhould break it. 2. That the neck of your Retort hang down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that the liquor may the eaſilier run into the Recipient. 3. That the end of the neck of your Retort enter into the middle of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106227:25"/> for fear the vapours received ſhould find ſome paſſage, even through their luted conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The Furnace, with a melting-fire, or the Wind-Furnace, to melt the hardeſt bodies; as Gold, Glaſs, Stones, in a Crucible, or unglazed Earthen pot: and it is thus made.</p>
               <p>Take two Loggs of Wood, or two great Stones, half a foot high; a Barrel knock'd out at the lower end, and having in the other a hole as big as a mans head, then ſet this Barrel upon the Stones or Loggs, and having laid a Grate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the uppermoſt hole, cover all this top with our Lute, and Plaſter together; and upon this erect a moveable Furnace, with the fire of ſuppreſſion, with our Bricks, as it has been ſaid before. The air coming in, with violence under the Barrel, does ſo blow and light the Coals, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a heat incomparably greater than any other.</p>

               <head>Of the Chymical Veſſels.</head>
               <p>THe Kettle, or Cauldron, ſerving for the <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> or Vaporous Bath. This Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is of the ſame matter and form as ordinary Kettles are, that is, Braſs: it muſt have no Bail, but round about it a brim of an inch broad, by which it is to be ſuſpended, upon the brim of the Furnace; this Kettles cover muſt exactly fit it, and have five round holes; whereof the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106227:26"/> muſt be the biggeſt, and capable of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a <hi>Glaſs-Cucurbit,</hi> or Body, with its head: the four other are leſs, and for little diſhes of Earth, or Glaſs, in which Extracts, and Salts are to be dried.</p>
               <p>The Veſica, or Copper-body, cover'd with its Moors-head, and bordered with its Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, ſerving to diſtil <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Aromatick and Balſamick Eſſences, Waters, and Spirits of Plants.</p>
               <p>This Veſica ought to be of Copper; not tinn'd within, and ſomewhat round bottom'd: it ought not to be thicker than a ſhilling, of one foot and a half high, and one foot broad in diameter: in its top it muſt be a little Convex, not in form of a Pear, as they ordinarily make them; and this, that it may repercute the phlegm of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and the Eſſences. From the middle of this top, riſes a neck four inches high, and three in diameter below, but four inches above; whoſe uſe is, to make the Cover of the Veſica enter ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and ſtick faſter, and ſo you ſee that this Veſſel is not unlike a Hogs-bladder; on one ſide of the top, riſes a little pipe two inches high, and half a finger wide, by which, with a Tin-tunnel you put in again the firſt Spirits of Wine that come a little muddy, becauſe they have carried along with them the ſmoot adhering to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of the Alembick: its Cover is of Braſs, and conſiſts of a neck half a foot deep, three inches large at the top and bottom, but four inches in the middle, becauſe within it muſt be five or ſix Spunges, ſo faſtned with croſs-ſticks under and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106227:26"/> over them, as to be kept from falling down into the Veſica, and from riſing up into the head: their uſe is, to draw to themſelves the aetherial Spirit of the <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or Brandy, and to hinder the phlegm (which in the middle of the Operation riſes with the Spirits) from paſſing any farther: for, the Spirit being thin and aery, eaſily makes way, where the groſs phlegm cannot; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falls down again into the Veſica: This neck is terminated in a round Ball, not unlike a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane skull, and is therefore called the Moors-head, from whoſe middle is derived a Pipe a foot long, and in diameter an inch wide, which goes through a Cauldron or Kettle, ſawder'd round about the Moors-head, and which muſt be of ſuch a proportion, as to contain a pale of water, which is poured in the Operation, cold, to the end that the Vapours that are in the Moors-head may be ſoon condenſed, and diſſolved into liquor. This Cauldron is therefore called a Refrigerato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: on one ſide of the brim there is a little cock, wherewith to empty the water if it grow too hot, and when the Operation is ended. The lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moveable neck, by which the Pipe coming from the Moors-head, muſt be join'd with the long Pipe that goeth through the Hogs-heads, ought to be half a foot long: the long Pipe which paſſes through the Hogs-heads, muſt be of Braſs, and ſix foot long, one inch wide in diameter; by little and little diminiſhing, as it comes nearer the end: This Pipe goes through two Hogs-heads, ſituated cloſe by one another, by four holes, ſo made, that the Pipe entring almoſt at the top of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106227:27"/> the neareſt, runneth down a-ſlope, to come out at the laſt hoop of the furthermoſt; afterwards the circumference of theſe holes muſt be ſtrongly luted; then fill with water your Hogs-heads, which will be another ſtrong Refrigeratory, and by condenſing the Spirits and Vapours in their way, make a copious diſtillation in a ſmall time.</p>
               <p>The open Limbick is made of two different pieces, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Body or Cucurbit, and its Head. The Body may be of Glaſs, Stone, or Earthen glaz'd ware, or of Braſs: it is always higher than it is broad; broader in its middle than in its bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and broader at the bottom than at the top, and round in all its breadth, by which deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you ſee that it is not unlike a Gourd. The head may be of the ſame matter as the body, and ſometimes of Lead; the top of it riſes in form of a point, the bottom is broad and proportioned to the body. In its lower part, it hath a brim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, on which the Vapours that riſe in it fall, and gently diſtil to the Noſe of the Pipe, which is of half a foot long, and conveys the liquors into the Receiver.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Veſſels, fitted one to another, ſerve to diſtil, and rectifie in a ſand-fire, <hi>per aſſenſum,</hi> the waters of Plants, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Spirit of Wine, the phlegm Oyl, and Spirit of Vegetables and Animals, and to rectifie the Phlegm and Spirit of Minerals. Before you put your Cucurbit into the ſand, you muſt lute two or three ſlices of white Paper upon the neck of your body, that ſo you may even it, and make it fit for the head, which muſt fit cloſe: upon theſe ſlices of Paper round
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106227:27"/> about the Glaſs-body, tye a pack-thread with a looſe knot; then with more Paper lute together the head, and its body over this pack-thread: the uſe of which, will be to undo eaſily theſe Veſſels, one from another, by drawing the pack-thread, and ſo breaking the Papers, when the Operation ſhall be ended.</p>
               <p>If you expect not a conſiderable quantity of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor from your matter, then make uſe of a ſmall Receiver, which you may hang to the Noſe of the Limbick, by a pack-thread faſtned to the little but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton that is on the top of its head; but, if it be big, and you hope for much liquor, then place it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon a little Stool, or upon Bricks laid one upon another.</p>
               <p>Blind Limbicks are made of a Cucurbit, and its head, ſealed hermetically to it, of the bigneſs of ones fiſt: in the top of the head there is a little hole, fit to receive the ſmall end of a Tunnel, by which the Liquors are poured into this Veſſel, and in the lower part of the head, there is a noſe by which the Liquors diſtil. Its uſe is, to rectifie the acid Spirits of Minerals, Vegetables and Animals, ſo that nothing be loſt, nor exhale from them; and therefore you muſt carefully ſtop the hole, by which you put in your matter, with a Glaſs or Cork-ſtopple.</p>
               <p>Twins or Pelicans are two blind Limbicks, whoſe noſes are reciprocally inſerted into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of one another: they muſt both have a hole in the top, for the uſe mentioned in the other: they ſerve to fix and circulate the Oyls, and Spirits, with their Salts, of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106227:28"/>
               <p> The Retort is a glaſs made up of a great belly, or ball, and a long bending neck, which near the belly is ſix or eight inches wide, but diminiſhing, ſtill grows leſs, till its end be but wide enough to put your finger in; it ſerves to diſtil by the ſide of the Furnace, and ordinarily in a naked circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory fire, the black Oyls, and Spirits of Minerals and Metals, and the ſtinking Oyls of Vegetables and Animals.</p>
               <p>The Iron or Earthen Retort, is like the Glaſs-one; only the neck is three inches diameter, near the belly, and two inches in its extremity; to the end, that groſs and heavy ingredients may the eaſilier be put in: it ſerves to diſtil the Spirit, and ſtinking Oyls of Woods, Barks, Roots and Berries.</p>
               <p>The Matraſs or Bolt-head is always of Glaſs, and may be of different ſizes: it conſiſts of a round bowl, convex in its bottom, with a neck half a foot long, or thereabouts, according to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the body; the neck is every where an inch wide: it ſerves to ſublime Mercury, and divers Salts.</p>
               <p>The Recipient is a Matraſs of any bigneſs, whoſe neck muſt be broken off four fingers breadth, near the belly; to the end that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the neck of the Retort may enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle of the body of the Receiver: it ſerves to receive Waters, Eſſences, Oyls and Spirits of Animals, Vegetables, Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
               <p>The way to make a Recipient of a Matraſs, is this: Heat the neck in that part where you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106227:28"/> to cut it off, and when it is very hot, wet it, and ſo knock it with a hammer, and it will break there where it has been wet; if it be not very even, you may with a key even it by little and little.</p>
               <p>The Stone, or Earthen Receiver, is of the ſame figure with the Glaſs one, only it has a wider neck to receive the Noſe of the Earthen Retort; you may uſe an Earthen Pitcher, if you cannot get a fit Receiver, ſo the neck of the Pitcher be ſtraight, and the belly big and wide, taking care to lute it cloſe with the Retort: but theſe Earthen Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſeldom uſed, except it be to receive the Spirits, and ſtinking Oyls of Wood, Rinds, Roots, Barks and Berries.</p>
               <p>The double Veſſel in form of a Matraſs, is a Matraſs with a long neck, into which is inſerted the neck of another Matraſs of the ſame bulk; in the ball, though its neck be a little leſs, and may, if you will, alſo be ſhorter, and go but half way into the firſt Matraſs; you muſt lute with three or four ſlices of Paper the Junction of theſe two Veſſels, that nothing may exhale: it ſerves to extract by Infuſion in a Sand-heat, all ſorts of Tinctures.</p>
               <p>The double Veſſel, in form of a Cucurbit or Body, is a Cucurbite of Glaſs, or Earth, upon whoſe mouth you place a Cup like your Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Glaſſes, with the mouth downwards; it having a little brim, by which it is ſuſpended upon the top of the Cucurbite: theſe two Veſſels muſt be cloſe luted together. The beſt Lute will be of Flower, or Starch, in form of a haſty Pudding.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106227:29"/> This Veſſel ſerves to extract by infuſion the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Aromatick Flowers, that ſo nothing may be loſt of their Spirit, and is fitter than the Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ordinarily uſed to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Bell is a great Glaſs-Veſſel, like the Bell Gardiners uſe to cover Melons withal. The uſe of this is, to draw the Spirit and Oyl of Sulphur, of Salt Armoniack, of Antimony, and Mars, or Iron, by covering with it an Earthen Pan; and if you turn it with the mouth upwards, it ſerves for precipitations, and waſhings or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Glaſs-Tunnel, though it be open at both ends, yet we reckon it among the Veſſels; as well, becauſe ſometimes by ſtopping the little end, it is really one, and contains Liquors, as becauſe there is ſomething worth obſervation in its Fabrick or making; it muſt have a ſtraight long neck: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being uſed in the blind Alimbeck, it muſt reach as far as within the Body, and not ſpill upon the inward brim of it; it muſt not have ſo large a belly as the Tin-Tunnels, leſt when you ſeparate your diſtilled Oyl from their Phlegm and Spirit, much of the Oyls be loſt by ſticking to the large ſides of your Tunnel. It ſerves to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Oyl from the acid Phlegm diſtilled with it, which is done by letting theſe two Liquors ſettle in the Tunnel, and then taking away your finger which ſtopped it, and giving leave to that Liquor which is lowermoſt to run out; which done, ſtop again the neck of your Tunnel, and let the remainder of your Liquor run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vial. It may be lined with a cornet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106227:29"/> of brown Paper, through which are filtrated Lixiviums, Waſhings, and divers other things, and may alſo ſtand you in ſtead of a Tin-Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
               <p>The Crucible is a pot; of which there are of different ſizes. It is made of the ſame earth as white ware; it is round without a handle very narrow at the bottom, and wider and wider to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top: it has a little Sinus or Cavity, by which the thing melted is poured out: it ſerves to calcine and melt Minerals and Metals, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a ſmall quantity.</p>
               <p>The Camion, is a Pot like an ordinary Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-pot with a handle to it. It is made of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Earth, and Sand; and therefore it holds out ſtrongly in the fire, which your Pots made of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Earth do not, but fly. There are two ſorts of theſe Pots, ſome are glazed, or leaded, and theſe ſerve to evaporate and dry; ſome are unglazed, and they ſerve to melt and calcine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and Metals, and every thing that needs ſuch preparation, eſpecially if you have a great quantity to prepare, theſe Camions being bigger than Crucibles.</p>
               <p>A Pan is an Earthen Veſſel ſtraight-bottom'd, and flat and wide-mouth'd. There are two ſorts: Glazed, that ſerves to evaporate in a naked fire Extracts, Syrups, Pills, Plaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glazed ones, which ſerve to evaporate in a Bath, or Sand heat, Salts, Cryſtals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to waſh ſalt Remedies.</p>
               <p>In ſome of our Operations, we make uſe of Utenſils of the Kitching; as Frying-Pans, to make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106227:30"/> the Oyl of Eggs; Kettles, and Braſs Baſins, to congeal the Cryſtal Mineral, and make our Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriums.</p>

               <head>Of the Chymical Fire.</head>
               <p>IN the governing of the Chymical fire, there are four things to be conſidered; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The materials of your fire; 2. The interpoſition of your fire; 3. The diſpoſition of your fire; and, 4. The ordering, governing, or regimen of your degrees of fire.</p>
               <p>The Materials are of five ſorts; whereof two are common, and the other three extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>viz.</hi> Coal, Wood, a Lamp, the Beams of the Sun, helped by a Burning-glaſs, and Horſe-dung.</p>
               <p>Your Coals muſt have two conditions to be good; they muſt be of good Wood, and of any Wood rather than of Oak, becauſe all Oak-Coals flyes, and may break your Glaſſes. 2. They muſt be very dry, that they may make a quick live-fire, and ſpare you the labour of blowing; the beſt Coal is that which is of a middle ſize, round, and of a Beech-Tree: the Wood muſt have the ſame qualities, for the ſame reaſons.</p>
               <p>The Lamp is a Tin-Box full of Oyl, in which ſwim three or four wicks, or links: this is ſet in the Lamp-Furnace; which ſerves to digeſt or diſtil, with a long and moderate heat, without any obligation of being preſent at the operation.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106227:30"/> Becauſe a Lamp-fire is very ſeldom uſed, we have not in the deſcription of Furnaces made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Lamp-Furnace, neither will we here ſay any more of its figure, and proportions, nor of the Oyl that is to be uſed; being reſolved to ſet down all theſe things more particularly in ſome of our Operations.</p>
               <p>The Sun-Beams ſerve to extract Tinctures; to make long digeſtions, to Calcine ſome Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, eſpecially when the ſaid Beams are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by a Burning-glaſs: which way we ſhall alſo deſcribe at length in ſome of our Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The Horſe-dung is uſed by putting into it Veſſels ſealed up hermetically, or cloſe ſtopped, there to ferment and circulate. We ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deſcribe this way in ſome of our Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The Interpoſition of the Chymical fire, is of four ſorts. 1. When between the Veſſel and the Fire, there is nothing but two Iron-Bars, or a little Round to ſet the Veſſel on, and this is called working by a naked fire. 2. When between the fire and the Veſſel, there is an Iron-plate, or Braſs Kettle, or an Earthen Pan, full of aſhes or ſand, into which the Veſſel is ſunk more or leſs; and this is called, Working with a Sand-fire, or of Aſhes. 3. When between the fire and the Veſſel, there is a Kettle full of Water, into which your Veſſel is ſet up to the neck; and this is called, working by a <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> or <hi>Mariae,</hi> that is, a Sea-Bath, or <hi>Maries</hi> Bath. 4. Is when between the fire and the Veſſel, there is a Kettle full of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106227:31"/> Water, which Kettle is covered, and its Cover has five holes in it, upon which are placed as many Veſſels to receive the Vapour of the Bath; and this is called Working by a Vaporous Bath.</p>
               <p>The diſpoſition of the Chymical fire is of four ſorts: 1. Where the fire is placed only under the Veſſels, as is done in the five Furnaces following, <hi>viz.</hi> of the great and ſmall Reverberatory of the circulary fire, of the ſand fire, of the <hi>Balneum Maris,</hi> and Vaporous Bath; and obſerve, that though in the two firſt Furnaces the heat is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation as ſtrong above as below the Veſſels, yet the fire is only under them. 2. Where the Coals are laid only round about the Veſſel upon the ground; and this is called <hi>Ignis rotae,</hi> or a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary fire. 3. Where the Coals are not only laid round about the Veſſel, but are heaped up to the top of it, and that is called a fire of half-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; but, if you cover even the top of your Veſſel with Coals, then 'tis a fire of whole-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. 4. Where the fire is altogether above the Veſſel, which is alſo a fire of ſuppreſſion; and is uſed in diſtillations <hi>per deſcenſum,</hi> for which Operation we make uſe of a great Earthen glazed Tunnel, of a little Iron Plate full of holes, and of a Kettle full of fire: which way of operating, we will teach more diſtinctly in ſome of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
               <p>The Regimen or Degree of the Chymical fire, is alſo of four ſorts: 1. When you give and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a ſmall fire, all along the Operation, as is practiſed in the firſt ſublimation of dulcified Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. 2. When you give a moderate heat either
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106227:31"/> at firſt, for fear of breaking your glaſſes, or by little and little, when there is the like danger; and then maintain this heat in ſuch an equality as to augment and diminiſh it when it paſſes the limits of moderation, as it is practiſed in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation of the Spirit of Wine; and in a ſand-fire, where you ſtop your aſh-hole door, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all your fire-room door; as alſo the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Regiſter, that ſo you may keep your Coals in that heat that they are in. 3. When you aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the heat by degrees, till you come to the laſt and greateſt you can procure, and that ſoon after, that your operation ceaſes as it is practiſed in the diſtillation of the Oyl of Bricks. And obſerve here, that all the activity of the fire is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four degrees; a little fire is the firſt degree; a moderate is the ſecond degree; a great fire is the third; and a very great and intenſe one is the fourth. 4. When you have augmented the fire by degrees, and are come to the laſt, which you maintain the ſpace of ſome hours, as it is done in the diſtillation of the black Oyl of Vitriol, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar.</p>

               <head>The Spirit of Salt.</head>
               <p>TAke a quantity of Potters-Earth, cut it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlices of the length, breadth and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a finger, and ſet them in order upon a Grid-iron; which you ſhall ſet upon red Coals in a hot Oven after the bread is drawn: when they are dry on one ſide, turn them on the other; then take them out, and powder them in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: and keep this Earth, thus dried and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as well for this Operation, as for divers others.</p>
               <p>Mingle five parts of this Earth, thus prepared, with one part of common Salt, beaten to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but not decrepitated; with this matter fill a Glaſs-Retort, of an ordinary ſize, which muſt be luted up to half the neck; ſet it in a cloſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory, and fit it to a large and capacious Glaſs-Receiver. Give your fire by degrees, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſoon as you can to the laſt degree, which continue twenty four hours, or till your Recipient ſeem cold, though the Retort be violently hot; from whence you may infer, that your matter hath ſent out all its Spirits: out of one pound of Salt by this method, you'll draw nine or ten oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Spirits.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, 1. This Earth is given to the Salt as an intermedium to hinder its fuſion: for Salt melts in a great fire, and being once melted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo fix, as there is no raiſing of its Spirits to diſtil them.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106227:32"/>
               <p> Obſerve, 2. That we rather make uſe of a Glaſs, than of an Earthen Retort; becauſe, the Spirits of Salt being very acid, and ſomething corroſive, might ſo penetrate the Earth of the Retort, as to loſe ſomething of their virtue, and dull their activity; therefore you muſt alſo keep your Spirit of Salt in Glaſs, not in Earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, 3. That the Salt muſt not be decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated, that is, ſeparated from its Phlegm, nor the Clay abſolutely dried, or heat red in the fire: for it is neceſſary, that there ſhould remain ſome watriſh humidity in both: to the end, that this phlegm coming, firſt in diſtillation, may help the acid Spirits, and be as a Vehicle to them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, were your fire never ſo violent, if there were no Phlegm, you would never obtain any acid Spirits.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, 4. That your Retort muſt be filled up to the neck, becauſe the Spirits, in their firſt riſing and ſeparating themſelves from their groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer parts, would, if there were any <hi>Vacuum,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently re-impregnate themſelves, and be ſo fix'd, as that no power of fire would be able to raiſe them again, and make them Volatil: whereas the Vapours raiſed, meeting with no empty room in the Retort, are not able to condenſe there, but by the fire are forced into the Recipient; into which they enter in form of a white Vapour, which by little and little cools, and condenſes, and at laſt diſſolves into a Liquor white and clear as water.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, 5. That that Phlegm which firſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106227:33"/> comes is little in quantity; and if you will have your Spirit ſtrong and pure, you may deflegmate and rectifie it in a ſand-heat.</p>
               <p>Its vertue and uſe is, It reſiſts all corruption taken interiourly, and outwardly applied; and for this reaſon in venomous and malign Feavers, we mingle three or four drops of it with a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Julip: and for a preſervation againſt the Plague, we put a ſpoonful of it into a quart of Oxycrate, and ſo rub the body all over before a good fire: It whitens the Teeth admirably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled with a little Water, or ſome ſyrup; it's a powerful diuretick againſt ſuppreſſions of Urine, cauſed by the oppilation of the conducts thorow which it ſhould paſs: it drives the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel out of the Kidneys and Bladder; and ſo is ſpecifick to break the Stone of the Kidneys and Bladder; that if you put a Stone cut out of a humane Bladder, into a quantity of Spirit of Salt, it will diſſolve immediately without fire, or any addition of any thing, though it were never ſo hard; it is uſed to diſſolve Gold, and make it Potable: if you do whet its Vertue, by putting to it a little Salt decrepitated before you put your Gold in it; alone it diſſolves Pearls and Coral.</p>
               <p>The marks whereby you may know and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh this Spirit from others, are theſe; 1. That it is clear and white, drawing to a citrine, tranſparent colour. 2. Being newly made, it is Vaporous, and ſeizes the noſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but without ſtink; and being old, it has no odour at all. 3. That upon your tongue it is of an acid biting faltiſh taſte. 4. It nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

That we give the Potters Earth to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as we do to Salt, to hinder its fuſion: now Niter is very eaſily melted, becauſe it is the Body which helps other Bodies to be ſo too; by reaſon of its great thinneſs, the abundance of its Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſubſtance, and its penetration; but when once it has been melted, it becomes ſo fix, that, having loſt all its Sulphur, it can neither evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nor be inflamed, though you put it into the fire: Then therefore it is called Salt of Niter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fix as Salts; whereas before its fuſion, it was ſo ſtrangely Volatil, that when you did but put a Coal into it, it preſently was in ſuch a flame, that it was almoſt quite conſumed.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3.

               <p>Its Vertues and uſe: This Spirit is Corroſive, not only applyed to Warts, rotten Fleſh, and the Gangreen, but it corrodes and diſſolves Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and the other Metals; it is often to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> for theſe two uſes; or it is not ſo burning in its action upon the fleſh, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis;</hi> and it is much fitter for the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are made by it of Mercury, and other Metals and Minerals, in order to the preparing of ſome remedy to be taken inwardly, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe pure Niter is an acid aperitive, and pure Vitriol is an acid vometive; as becauſe Niter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sulphureous Salt, drawn from temperate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, and Vitriol, a terreſtrious Salt drawn from Minerals, by their union in the compoſition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis,</hi> is produced a malignous quality. Nay, it is fitter than <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> for the diſſolution of Minerals in order to make Fucuſes for the face, becauſe the Spirit of Niter, applyed to the skin, leaves but a little yellow ſpot, which may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taken away; whereas <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> leaves a deep orange-ſpot, ſo ſticking, and adhering, that it can never be taken out, but with the loſs of the skin; from whence we may infer, that a <hi>Fucus</hi> prepared with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſhould rather black than whiten the skin.</p>
               <p>The marks to diſtinguiſh this Spirit, are theſe: 1. That it is of the ſame colour and tranſparency as the Spirit of Salt. 2. That it is very vaporous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106227:35"/> and ſtinking, coming near the ſtinking ſmell of <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> 3. It is too corroſive and biting, to be taſted upon the Tongue; but, to try its goodneſs, pour out ſome drops upon a Braſs half-peny, and, if it be right, it will preſently boil, and makes the half-peny ſtir, it produces a blew colour in the ſaid half-peny. 4. It cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes, and makes its Linen-ſtopple look yellow, as <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> uſes to do; ſometimes the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur are ſophiſticated by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little Spirit of Niter, or a little <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> into common Water, till there reſult an acid taſte, which is not cauſtick: but you ſhall perceive this cheat, if having rubbed a Paper with the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur in one place, and the Spirit of Niter and common Water in another place, you preſent the ſaid Paper to the fire; for then the place rubb'd with the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur, will grow black and break; and the place rubb'd with Spirit of Niter in common Water, will only grow yellow, and not break.</p>

               <p>TAke an Earthen-pot unglazed, of the Earth they make Crucibles of, fill it up to the brim with good green Vitriol; ſet this pot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Salt-ſeller in a great Circulatory fire: in two hours time, or there abouts, your Vitriol having firſt diſſolved into a Liquor, will be dryed, defleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106227:35"/> and at laſt coagulated into a grayiſh lump; then take out your pot, let it cool, and, when cold, put your matter into a Braſs or Iron Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and powder it.</p>
               <p>Take a Glaſs Retort, well luted up to half the neck; fill it with the ſaid Vitriol, and place it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art, in a great Reverberatory fire, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it a great Receiver. Give your fire by degrees, coming as ſoon as you can to the laſt, which continue till you perceive, in the top and ſides of your Receiver, a kind of black Veins that trickle down to the bottom; theſe are the black Oyl which begins to diſtil. Then unlute your Receiver from its Retort, and ſeparate by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the acid Spirit of Vitriol, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto has been diſtilled, and which is of a white and tranſparent colour like Water, and which entered your Receiver in the form of a white Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</p>
               <p>By this time your Vitriol will be calcin'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a red colour, and brought to be a Colcothar, which yet retains its black Oyl. Which to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, you muſt again fit the Receiver to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort without lute; for elſe, the neck of the Retort being exceeding hot, would preſently break by the approach of the cold, and moiſt Lute; continue then your fire, and give it in the higheſt degree, for the ſpace of ſix, or eight hours, till your Receiver be cold, though the fire be vehement under the Retort, by that you'll perceive that the contain'd matter has yielded all its black and thick Oyl. Let your fire go out: then take out your Retort, which by the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106227:36"/> long violence of the fire will ſeem ſomewhat ſunk and ſtraitned, and in it will remain a Colcothar, deveſted of its phlegm, its Spirit, and its black Oyl; but yet containing the fixed Salt of Vitriol, and therefore is not ſo ſharp and acrimonious as the firſt Colcothar. 'Tis out of this ſecond Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar, that you may extract the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of Vitriol, by making a <hi>Lexivium</hi> of the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar, to extract its fixed Salt. Out of one pound of green Vitriol, you'll have nine or ten ounces of Spirit, with its Phlegm, and half an ounce of black Oyl. The acid Spirit of Vitriol contains much Phlegm, which came firſt with it; therefore if you deſire to have a purified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you muſt evaporate the Phlegm by putting this Spirit Inflegmated into a Matraſs not luted, which ſet upon a Salt-ſeller in a ſmall Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fire, till the whole ſubſtance be half dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and begin to look a little yellowiſh; if you continue this Evaporation any longer, your Spirit will become blackiſh, drawing near the colour and acidity of your Oyl of Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar.</p>
               <p>If reciprocally with the ſaid black Oyl of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar, you deſire to make a white acid Spirit, do but mingle in a Matraſs one dragm of the ſaid Oyl with an ounce of common water; then you ſhall ſee that the ſaid Oyl will preſently go to the bottom; and will ſo heat the neck of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs, that you will ſcarce be able to hold it in your hand. Mingle them well by agitation, till the water grow blackiſh, then through Paper fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the ſaid liquor, and there will come a clear
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106227:36"/> acid Spirit, as yellow as Gold, which will have the ſame force and virtue as the common Spirit of Vitriol; the Paper retaining the black and thick <hi>faeces.</hi> From whence we may conclude, that this clear Liquor, which we call Spirit of Vitriol, is nothing but a ſmall portion of the true Spirit mingled with a great deal of Phlegm, and that this black Liquor which we call Oyl, is indeed a pure Spirit of Vitriol, entirely dephlegmated, but becauſe of its Sulphureous blackneſs and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is improperly called Oyl, being ſomewhat unctuous to the feeling, though it be not at all inflameable, as all true Oyls are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That you muſt dephlegmate the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and powder it well before you put it into your Retort; elſe you would not draw off the Spirit, but the Phlegm alone: for, the matter would coagulate in the bottom of the Veſſel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lump, which ſticking cloſe to the ſides of the Retort, would ſo retain all the Spirits, that a ſtrong fire of forty hours laſting, would ſcarce be able to reduce this maſs to powder: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is better to dephlegmate and reduce to powder your Vitriol, before it be put into the Retort.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we give no Intermedium to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, as we do to Salt and Niter; becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a terreſtrious Salt, it cannot be melted, and by conſequent, cannot fix and retain its Spirits within its ſelf: ſo that, provided it be dephleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, the Spirits are eaſily raiſed, and diſtilled by the violence of the fire.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106227:37"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That you need not fill your Retort up to the neck with your matter, becauſe the Spirit of Vitriol, having not ſo much tenuity as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Salt and Niter, is not in danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impregnating and fixing its ſelf in its own maſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That the Retort muſt be of Glaſs, for the reaſon alledged in the Spirit of Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. That you chuſe good Vitriol, not too dry; for it will yield more Spirit and Oyl: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which comes from <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countries, is better than the <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol for this effect.</p>
               <p>Its virtue and effects: Both the white Spirit, and the black Oyls, are Acids, which pleaſantly and excellently do cool, deſopilate, and reſiſt all corruption: and therefore they are frequently, and with good ſucceſs, made uſe of for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Kidneys, in burning and Peſtilentious Feavers. The doſe is five or ſix drops of the Spirit, two or three of the Oyl, either in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Broth, or White Wine: It ſerves for the diſſolution of Metals; and in Surgery it is uſed, either pure, or mingled with a little water or <hi>Mel roſatum,</hi> to touch the ulcers of the mouth.</p>
               <p>The firſt and ſecond <hi>Colcothar</hi> are both an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Aſtringent, given in violent <hi>Diarrhoea's, Dyſenteries,</hi> and Hepatick Fluxes: or, mingled with ſome unguents, it ſtops bleeding Wounds.</p>
               <p>The Marks to diſtinguiſh the Oyl of Vitriol from other, are theſe: 1. It is very black: 2. It is not only acid, but cauſtick: 3. It is very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106227:37"/> heavy: 4. It ſeizes the noſe, with a ſtrong Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, when new made; and in all theſe four conditions, it is like the Oyl of Sulphur.</p>
               <p>As for the Spirit, it is known by its pleaſant acidity, by its yellowiſh colour: and becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, it yields no ſmell, no more than Spirit of Sulphur, neither doth it corrode, or make its ſtopple yellow; the Spirits of Niter and <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from it by their ſmell; and becauſe they corrode, and change the colour of their ſtopples: Spirit of Salt is known from it, becauſe it has a brackiſh taſte, and ſmells ſtrong when new, being much more intolerable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant than Spirit of Vitriol.</p>

               <p>Set your Retort in a little Reverberatory, or in a little Circulatory fire, (a great Reverberatory being not ſo neceſſary here, becauſe the Niter is of it ſelf ſo volatil; and having melted the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, it makes it likewiſe capable of yielding its Spirits

               <p>Its virtue and uſe: This is a very cauſtick burning water; ſome do touch Warts and Corns with it: but it is dangerous ſo to do, and our Chymiſtry will afford us gentler and fitter reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which I ſhall ſet down hereafter.

               <p>TAke as much good <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> as will fill your Veſica or Copper body half full: ſet it in a naked Circulatory fire; fit to it its cover or Moors-head, bordered with its Refrigeratory,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106227:40"/> having before hand put into the Veſica's long neck five or ſix ſponges, held up by two ſticks ſet a-croſs, and kept from falling down or riſing up: Then to the Moors-head Noſe fit the moveable Pipe, which ſhall join it with the long Braſs Pipe that goes through the two Hogs-heads of water; then ſtarch on long ſlices of Paper upon all the conjunctions of the Pipes; and over the Paper, put cloth-ones, which bind faſt with pack-thread: fit your Receiver of glaſs to the lower end of the long Braſs Pipe that goes through the Hogs-heads; ſet your Coals on fire, and add ſome wood to them, to make at firſt a great fire, which may raiſe and diſtil your Spirit quickly. In a very little time, it will come not by drops, but in a ſmall ſtream like a Fountain. In all the courſe of this Operation, there muſt be ſingular care taken that the diſtillation be equal and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, ſo that as ſoon as you perceive white va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours in the Recipient, diminiſh your fire; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by throwing aſhes on it, or taking a good deal of it away. For theſe white Vapours are the Spirits which come in ſuch an abundance, that they have not had time to condenſe, neither in the Moors-head, nor in the long Pipe, and therefore will eaſily ſcape out of your Receiver, and ſo the beſt of your Spirit will be loſt to no purpoſe: beſides, whenſoever the Diſtillation is performed in too big a ſtream, though there be no Vapours, yet diminiſh your fire. But if it ſhould come drop by drop, then augment the heat; you may take notice that the firſt quart that comes, though excellent and pure, yet it is not clear,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106227:41"/> but muddy, having contracted a foulneſs from the ſides of the Veſſel; therefore throw it in again with a Tunnel by the little Pipe, which on purpoſe is in the top of the Veſica, and preſently ſtop the ſaid Pipe cloſe with its Woodden ſtopper; the Spirit that ſhall from henceforth be diſtilled, will be clear and tranſparent. By this method, out of thirty quarts of good <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> you may draw eighteen quarts of good Spirit of Wine in a day, and in one only Veſica. You muſt obſerve often, all along your Operation, whether your Spirit be well deflegmated; which try thus: Put as much Gunpowder as you can take up with your two fore-fingers and your thumb, into a little ſpoon, which fill with Spirit of Wine; then fire it with a Match, or lighted Paper: for if this Spirit take fire and burn blew, till it be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then fire the Gunpowder, and that at laſt there be no mark of any moiſtneſs left in the ſpoon, you may be ſure your Spirit is very pure, and very good.</p>
               <p>The laſt Spirit that comes, is not good, as well becauſe it brings phlegm with it, as becauſe it ſmells of the <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> or burning; and having been long in the Veſica, is ſomewhat impregnated with the ſubſtance and qualities of the Copper. Therefore ſet it aſide to be uſed exteriourly, or in Mechanicks; or elſe rectifie it again with new Brandy. Whenſoever your perceive that there comes ſome muddy whitiſh drops, which make the clear Spirit which was in the Receiver change its colour, then know that it is time to make an end of the Operation: for theſe drops are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106227:41"/> the flegm which produces this effect upon the pure Spirit: for if you put two or three drops of Water into good Spirit of Wine, it will do the ſame thing. There will remain in the Veſica twelve quarts of flegm muddy and greeniſh from the Copper; this tincture is to be thrown away.</p>
               <p>This Spirit of Wine does alſo contain in it ſelf ſomething of the Copper: nevertheleſs it may be taken ſafely by the mouth, becauſe that Copper extracted by this Spirit, is not ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as Verdigreece extracted out of Copper by Vinegar. Nay, the Copper does contribute much to the preſervation of this Spirit in its force. But, if in a Glaſs Alembick you will take the pains to rectifie it, and reduce your eighteen quarts to fifteen, then you may without ſcruple uſe it in all manners; and in the bottom of your Cucurbit, there will remain a green tincture, which is a flegm impregnated, with the Salt and Sulphur of Venus, or Copper.

               <p> How to ſeparate entirely the Spirit from the Oyl. Fill a Glaſs-Retort half full, (your Retort muſt be luted, only there muſt be upon the neck a long empty ſpace left to ſee into it, that ſo you may perceive towards the end of the Operation, of what colour your Oyl is:) ſet your Retort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Round, in the little Circulatory fire, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil your matter, till you have three parts of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of it, and that in the bottom of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort you ſee a thick red Oyl, almoſt of the colour of a Pomgranate. Take then your Retort off from the fire, and pour out this hot Oyl into an Earthen Pan of white ware. As for the Spirit which you have in the Receiver, rectifie it again in the ſame Retort, and by the ſame ſort of fire, ſo as to diſtil three quarters and an half in Spirit, and the reſt remain in form of a thick red Oyl: which done, pour out the ſaid Oyl to that which you have already. Then rectifie your Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, doing thus, as long as you can extract any Oyl out of it: then your Spirit will be right and pure, deveſted of its Oyl, and without ſmell; but it will ſtill have its force and acrimony.</p>
               <p>The Uſe and Virtues of the Spirit. 'Tis a powerful Diuretick, and makes the Gonorrhaea's flow abundantly, by melting and inciding thoſe tough and clammy humours, which ſtop the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Sperm and Urine: It diſſolves the ſoft Stones which are not yet ſtrongly petrified: It diſſolves all Gums better than Spirit of Wine, and that without any additional heat, either of Fire or Sun; Therefore it is uſed in making the beſt Verniſh: it diſſolves with a ſmall heat Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106227:43"/> and makes a better Balſam of it than that which is made with the oyly Spirit of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, bought at the Druggiſts. The <hi>Provencals,</hi> who are great Drawers of Eſſences, uſe it in all their Operations, either upon Flowers or Woods, Barks, Leaves or Berries, both Aromatick and Balſamick, becauſe this Spirit being naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous, is eaſily impregnated with the oyly Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of theſe Druggs; and becauſe it has no ſmell of its own, it eaſily takes the Aromatick or Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Odour of any of thoſe that are infuſed in it, and then diſtil it in the Veſica, as we do Spirit of Wine. For do not think that their Eſſences are pure, and drawn from their Druggs alone: no, they are nothing but Spirit of Turpentine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the Eſſence of them. So that this Spirit has a double uſe; for it extracts the Eſſence, and multiplies it conſiderably.</p>

               <p>TAke equal parts of pure Nitar and good <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> either white or red; powder them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part very fine: then mingle them in a glazed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Pan; then, with a red hot Iron, ſtir all this maſſe, until the Niter be entirely conſumed and evaporated, which you ſhall know by the ceaſing of flagration or burning. Thus your <hi>Tartar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly calcin'd, will afford you a Salt as white as Snow, and the ſame in weight with that which you mingled with the Niter at firſt; whence you may conclude, that <hi>Tartar</hi> is all Salt.</p>
               <p>The Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> is made thus: Set this Salt in a very wet air, ſuch as the air of a Celler, there it will melt, and diſſolve into a white viſcous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which we call Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> by ſolution, to diſtinguiſh it from the black ſtinking Oyl, which is drawn by diſtillation in a Retort and open fire: nevertheleſs, to ſpeak properly, the name of Oyl is not due to either of them, becauſe they are neither Sulphurous nor inflamable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If after you have made the Salt of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> you are in haſte to have the Oyl, you may preſently compaſs your end by throwing eight ounces of common Water upon four ounces of this Salt of <hi>Tartar;</hi> for then it will all diſſolve into Liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That you chuſe good <hi>Tartar;</hi> for that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106227:44"/> is all Salt: whereas the groſſer ſort of <hi>Tartar</hi> has much of faeces, and terreſtreity in it, which would ſpoil this Operation, in which we pretend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all the Salt into Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That your Niter be well deveſted of all its fixt Salt, becauſe we deſire here a pure Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> without the mixtion of any other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Niter muſt be entirely volatil, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale all in the flagration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That they both be well powder'd, and mingled together, that ſo the Niter penetrating the <hi>Tartar,</hi> do throughly calcine it; and it is for this reaſon that we uſe an equal quantity of Niter: By this method the <hi>Tartar</hi> is far better and eaſilier calcin'd than by the naked fire, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedium.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That we make uſe here of an earthen glazed Pan, without any fear that the Niter ſhould corrode the Lead of the Verniſh; becauſe its flame is not retained, but is at liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale. An unglazed or ſtone-Pan would be unfit for the Operation, becauſe it would preſently break by the Inflammation of the Niter.</p>
               <p>The Virtues and Uſe of the Salt: 'Tis a great Aperitive, Deopilative, and Diuretick; the doſe is from one to two dragms, in ſome Broth, or any other appropriated Liquor. The <hi>Tartar</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolated, becauſe of the grateful acidity which it borroweth from the Vitriol, is much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to take than this Salt. This Salt, in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of half a ſcruple, will extract in a quarter of an hour the virtue and tincture of half an ounce of Senna, in a glaſs of cold water, and at the ſame
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106227:44"/> time proves a good Corrective to the noiſom ſmell and taſte of the Senna, giving it alſo the virtue of penetrating into all the Veins.</p>
               <p>The Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> is very ſcouring and drying; and is therefore excellent to rub all Scabs, Itch, and Tetters; as alſo to take away Spots, and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns upon the Hands and Face. It is uſeful to precipitate the diſſolutions of Metals, and Half-metals, or Marcaſites.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106227:45"/> of Brimſtone in powder, which immediately will take fire, and be conſumed: when the flame ceaſes, throw in as much more, and ſo do three or four times.

This done, pour a little of this melted Niter into a Braſs-tinn'd-Kettle, and preſently ſet your Pot upon the fire again, having taken away a good part of the Coals round about it; then ſtir your Kettle ſo, as to make the Niter ſpread it ſelf all over the bottom of your Veſſel; which done, ſet it in a bigger Veſſel full of cold Water, that ſo you may hinder the Niter from burning, and adhering too ſtrongly to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your Kettle: ſeparate then at laſt this white Cruſt, which is as thin and as brittle as Glaſs, and as white as Alabaſter, and is by ſome called <hi>Cryſtal Mineral.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That you muſt not ſtay till your Pot be warm, before you put in your Niter; becauſe the Pot being very hot, and the flegm of the Niter coming to be diſſolved firſt, would be broke infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly. Therefore put in your Niter at firſt; and ſo by degrees, as your Pot warms, your Niter will

And whenſoever Salts are entirely calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or deflegmated, they cannot be melted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be wet anew by ſome waſhings, and then they grow whiter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. That if while the Niter is deflegmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, there chance to fall into it any ſmall live Coal, then it will all be in a flame, till the Coal be conſumed; and, to extinguiſh this flame, there is no way but to take out the ſaid Coal, and to cover the pot.</p>

The reaſon why the pot will be broken, is, becauſe that then the Spirits of the Niter, being ſtrongly heated, fly out of their body, and ſo corrode and break the pot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 8. That the Niter does not take fire in the pot; becauſe, that though a ſpoonful of Niter caſt into a pot red-hot, will preſently be in a flame, and vaniſh all away in ſmoak; yet a great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106227:46"/> quantity of Niter, even after its deflegmations, cannot be ſet a-fire, but by a red-hot Coal, unleſs you uſe a fire of Suppreſſion, and ſo penetrate the pot, as to make it fire the Niter. And that cannot be done, becauſe in ſuch an Operation, an Earthen or Iron Pot or Crucible would break, and a Glaſs one would melt down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 9. That the Niter, being melted, is not afterwards coagulated into a lump upon the fire, as Vitriol and Alum uſe to do; becauſe they are groſs terreſtrious Salts, which Niter is not.</p>

That you muſt take well purified Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſo there be leſs of fix'd Salt in it: for, the fix'd Salt is eaſily diſſolved into Water; and therefore your Niter being clear of it, will make your Cryſtals whiter and drier; if you uſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary unrefin'd Niter, your Cryſtals will be apt to diſſolve into Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 11. That the Brimſtone takes fire in the melted Niter, and yet inflames not the Niter; becauſe the oyly ſubſtance of the Brimſtone is dryer than the Niter, and becauſe that the Niter can ſcarce ever be well deflegmated: for its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by reaſon of their great thinneſs, are ſubject to evaporate, and be gone with the flegm; as alſo, becauſe no Veſſel can long contain melted Niter, without breaking or melting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 12. That the Brimſtone purifies the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe that the groſſer part of the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which has not been a-fire, mingling its ſelf with the melted Niter, hurries along with it to the bottom all the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Niter.</p>

Of its black <hi>Faeces,</hi> which it had contracted in thoſe Veſſels in which Niter is groſly prepared at firſt; and ſo you ſee, unleſs you filtrate it, and then cryſtallize it, it is not ſufficiently purified. When once it has been cryſtallized, then you may diſſolve it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and reduce it into a white Cruſt, which is called <hi>Lapis Prunellae.</hi> Now the <hi>Cryſtal Mineral</hi> loſes its flegm, by the melting of the Niter it is deveſted of; its Smoot by the flagrations of the Brimſtone, and by the filtration; and it loſes its fix'd Salt by the cryſtallization.</p>

               <p>Take notice, That in this firſt flagration your Cup breaks infallibly, becauſe it is not lined or fenced with any thing that can hinder the Niter from exrciſing its activity upon it. In a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, the Vapours will be paſſed, and diſſolved into the three Subſtances I have ſpoken of; which done, break that little reddiſh skin upon the ſuperficies of the Spirit of Urine; to the end, that in the following flagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Spirit of Urine may be impregnated with the acid Spirits of the Sulphur and Niter, which could not be, if that skin remained entire: then take away your broken Cup, in which you will find a whitiſh Cruſt left.

               <p>Then augment the heat, that ſo in a ſmall time you may evaporate the nitrous red Spirits ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining: then, if with this augmentation of heat your matter does not boil, take it off from the fire, and pour it very hot into a ſtone-Pan, ſtirring and turning your Pan ſo as to make your liquor congeal, and ſpread it ſelf all over equally, in the form of a Cruſt, as white as Alabaſter, but as brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as Glaſs.</p>

The <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſend good quantities of it hither, but it is ordinarily ſophiſticated, by the mixtion of white Arſenick, which is very heavy, and but ten pence a pound; whereas Mercury is worth four or five ſhillings a pound; beſides, that Arſenick being incorporated with the Sublimate, is a ſtrong poyſon. But you will eaſily perceive this Cheat, if you pour a little Oyl of Tartar, made <hi>per deliquium,</hi> upon your Corroſive Sublimate: if it be good, and without mixtion of Arſenick, it will become as yellow as Gold; if there be Arſenick, it will grow as black as Ink. Beſides, the beſt Sublimate of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> is made into little Grains, as big as Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed: but the Sublimate of <hi>Holland,</hi> is in great Splinters, as Mineral, Antimony, or Biſmuth; and this is, becauſe the Arſenick cannot be ſo well incorporated with the ſaid Mercury, as common Salt, Niter, and Vitriol.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we take of Sublimate and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver equal parts; becauſe, if there were leſs Corroſive Sublimate, it could not corrode, and calcine the Mercury: and if there were more, it would be hard to dulcifie the Mercury: 'Tis expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught us this proportion.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106227:52"/> there would much of it be loſt in the little pores of the Earth: but all theſe inconveniences are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by making uſe of a Marble Glaſs, or White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware Diſh, which indeed is but the dreggs of Glaſs, refined and cryſtallized.</p>

That we uſe diſtilled Vinegar to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate the Quickſilver, with the Corroſive Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; becauſe, the Vinegar, having a Salt, helps the corroſion of the Mercury; and therefore fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more their intimate mixtion, than a Liquor which had not ſuch a Salt would do; but undiſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vinegar, and particularly of Red-wine, is not good, becauſe it would alter the whiteneſs of this Remedy. The Spirit of Vitriol is worſe, for it would make it black: ſpittle would do well enough, but it is dangerous to ſpit upon the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, leſt in ſpitting, ſome of it ſhould get into the mouth.</p>

But in the ſecond Sublimation we give a greater Fire, and raiſe the Sublimate to the middle of the Matraſs; becauſe then we deſire to purifie exactly our Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate from its <hi>Faeces,</hi> and by evaporating the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant venomous volatil Salts, have a fair cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Sublimate.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. That if in the ſecond Sublimation, when all your powder is ſublim'd, you do not take your Matraſs off from the Fire, it will grow
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106227:52"/> yellow, and blackiſh; nay, the more you ſublime it, the blacker it will grow; becauſe the Mercury being deveſted of the pureſt part of its Salt, who have left behind a ſulphureous ſmoot, begins to burn, change colour, and at laſt grow black.</p>

The Vertue Purgative of this Remedy, is, as it were, whited, and ſharpened. Now while the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a calcining, and purifying by theſe Salts, it riſes more or leſs, according to the heat, by its own nature, which is Volatil, and by the means of the Niter, which is joyned with it. And this we call ſubliming; for the common Salt, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, are hurried away, and carried up by the Mercury and Niter, and by their Nature, which is not Volatil: they keep the Mercury and Niter from riſing ſo high, as to run out of the Matraſs.</p>

When your Mercury is quite diſſolved, then, to go the ſhorter way to work, evaporate the Spirit of Niter, your Retort being in the ſame poſture ſtill: but if you mean to draw off the ſaid Spirit of Niter, then ſet your Retort in a diſtilling poſture, and fit to it a Recipient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing your fire in the ſame degree as before.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106227:55"/> over: ſtir a little your Matraſs with your hands, to heat the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> then ſet your veſſel on warm aſhes, to help a little more your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in its action upon the Mercury: but have a care you give not a greater heat than is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a gentle ebullition; for, if your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> be over-heated, and opened, it will tinge (by the means of its Vitriol) your Mercury in a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour: as ſoon as your Mercury is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolved, which may be done in half an hour, pour your diſſolution into an earthen Stone Pan, or glaſs Bell (the glazed earth being unfit, becauſe the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> would diſſolve the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh) then pour upon your matter cold ſea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, well filtrated, and impregnated with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt undecrepitated; you may uſe about a quart of this Water, till your diſſolved Mercury be all precipitated to the bottom of your Veſſel, in a white powder. And take notice, that if you had uſed common water, you would not have precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated your Mercury, but turned your diſſolution into a white Liquor, which would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it ſelf of a white ſharp powder: becauſe that common water, having no ſalt, cannot fight with the ſalts of the <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> but if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with a contrary ſalt, there ariſes a conflict, during which the Mercury ſcrapes, and falls to the bottom, leaving behind him a good part of his ſalts. This done, ſeparate by Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your ſea-water, and pour a great quantity of common water upon your matter, to take away the <hi>Acrimony,</hi> which the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> by its Niter and Vitriol has communicated to the Mercury,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106227:56"/> and continue this, till your water come off inſipid. Then, having pour'd off your laſt water, filtrate the remainder in a brown, or rather white Paper, to preſerve the colour; and dry your Precipitate in the ſhade: for, if you do it in the Sun, or by the Fire, it will loſe much of its whiteneſs; when it is very dry, keep it in a cloſe Vial, well ſtopped, and covered with an oyl'd Bladder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That though this Remedy be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet we uſe <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and not Spirit of Niter; becauſe, <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> coſts leſs, and is ſooner made than Spirit of Niter; which undoubtedly, without this reaſon of ſparing, would be much fitter for this Operation: yet, we think that the great Lotions that are made, do dulcifie it, as if it had been prepared with Spirit of Niter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we take as much again of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> as of Niter; as well, becauſe the diſſolvant muſt be ſtronger than the thing diſſolv'd, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Experience teaches, that ſuch a Doſe of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is neceſſary to diſſolve the Mercury entirely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That the Matraſs muſt be long necked, that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> rais'd by the heat, to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the neck, may cool, be condenſed, and fall down again; for, in this Operation, we pretend to nothing, but to diſſolve and calcine Philoſophically, and lightly, the Mercury, without penetrating its Body, and opening it by the Salts of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> as we mean to do in the Red Precipitate: and thence it comes, that this Mercury, after its preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, retains its white colour, and the nature of Quickſilver.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That if you pour hot Sea-water on your Diſſolutions, then you will not be able to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate entirely your Mercury; becauſe, that the ſalt Sea-water, being ſharpened by an actual heat, would penetrate and diſſolve a part of the ſaid Mercury, in ſtead of precipitating it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. That to make Sea-water, you muſt not take decrepitated Salt; becauſe, it would be to no end to take away the flegm, ſince you are to put it into Water; and as for purifying it, filtration will do that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. That the White Precipitate, is nothing but Mercury opened, and calcined by the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and retaining but very little of the Salts of the ſaid <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> the reſt being carried away by the dulcorations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Vertue:</hi> It is the gentleſt of all the Purgatives drawn from Mercury, though it be diſſolved by <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> becauſe it has been ſweetned by Lotions: It purges nevertheleſs more violently than the ſweet Sublimate, and its Doſe is leſs: For, to Children it is from three to ſix Grains, and for Aged perſons, it is from ſix to fifteen: It cures the Pox taken interiourly; and being diſſolved with Oyl, it may be exteriourly uſed by Frictions, to cure the Itch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Remedy fluxes as eaſily as the ſweet Sublimate; becauſe, the Mercury being unfix'd in theſe Preparations, has his wings left him, wherewith he preſently flies upwards, in ſtead of purging by Stools.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That we uſe here <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> to calcine Mercury, becauſe the Remedy which we intend is a Topick exteriour one, to corrode, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all ſuperfluous fleſhly Excreſcences; and it is neceſſary, that it ſhould be in greater quantity, than the Mercury, to diſſolve it entirely. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, calcin'd Mercury does not retain its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral whiteneſs; becauſe, the Vitriol of the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> communicates this tincture, and becauſe that the Fire here, is much more violent, than that which is us'd in the preparation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, call'd <hi>Turbith Mineral.</hi> The diſſolvant being alſo much more over-heated, and penetrating by the help of the Fire, communicates a ſulphureous colour.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That the Precipitate is found to be equal in weight to the Mercury, that was diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; becauſe, though in this Operation it have loſt ſomething of its volatil part, yet it hath impregnated it ſelf with ſome of the Salts of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> as much as to make up the weight: and theſe Salts it will keep, till it be reviv'd, and made Cuickſilver again.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That we here make uſe of Niter to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and ſet in fuſion the body of Antimony, though we do alſo imploy the Tartar to hinder a too great ebullition of the ſaid Antimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the Niter being ſomewhat buſie in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining the Tartar, cannot employ all its force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Antimony; beſides, the Tartar being not inflameable by its nature, hinders the Niter from cauſing this ebullition; and being withall a gentle Salt, it purifies, cleanſes, and whitens the Antimony. Then we uſe Wood-Coals in powder for the ſame end, and becauſe alſo the Coals being ſpongious, are apt to draw to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and retain the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Antimony. Now it is very neceſſary in this Operation, to prevent the ebullition, leſt the Antimony ſhould run over the pot, and be loſt, we uſe alſo but one proportion of Niter to two of Antimony, for fear the flagration ſhould be too quick, and we keep all the matter longer upon the fire than we do the <hi>Crocus metallorum,</hi> to give the Regulus time to ſeparate from its <hi>Faeces.</hi>

That the Regulus of Antimony is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Antimony opened, and melted by the Niter, ſomewhat more intimately, than the Liver of Antimony; becauſe of the addition that is made here of the Tartar and Charcoal; and alſo, by reaſon of the continuation of the fire, which deveſts it of its terreſtreity, and of a good part of its venomous Sulphur, and flowers: but yet it is endowed with a great emetick, and purgative vertue. Therefore we have not uſed here much Niter; and though the fire has been more violent than in the Liver of Antimony, yet it has not been ſtrong enough to baniſh all the vomitive and purgative vertue, as ſhall be done in the Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Antimony.</p>

                  <hi>The Vertues and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe:</hi> It is a milder vomative, and a gentler purgative, than the <hi>Crocus metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> and it is uſed in three different ways. 1. It may be powder'd and infus'd, and ſo make a <hi>Vinum emeticum,</hi> as has been ſaid in the <hi>Crocus metallorum.</hi> 2. We make of it eternal Pills. 3. We make Cups of it, in which Wine infus'd, becomes purgative, and emetick. 4. It ſerves alſo to make the Diaphoretick, by calcining it with Niter, either in a fire of ſuppreſſion, or in the Sun-beams by a burning-glaſs.</p>
               <p>To make the everlaſting Pills, you muſt have a Mould for leaden Bullets, of the bigneſs of an ordinary pill: lute, with our Lute, the lower
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106227:63"/> parts, and all the ſides of your Mould, to the end that your melted liquor being thereby kept in, may be fitly and handſomly ſhaped into the form of Pills; then take as much as you pleaſe of your Regulus, and put it into an iron melting ſpoon, with a long handle: which ſet, upon a great fire of ſuppreſſion, or in a wind Furnace: cover the ſaid ſpoon with a dry Tyle, not a wet one, leſt it ſhould fly, then pour coals upon your ſpoon, thus covered, and give a melting fire, till your matter be red hot, and perfectly melted, and as ſhining and bright as quickſilver; then pour gently your matter into your mould, and when it is cold, take out your Pills, which ſtick all one to another; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them; and with a knife even them ſo, as they may have no unequal parts, which might hurt the throat, eſophage the Maw, the Guts, or the Fundament.</p>
               <p>One of theſe Pills may ſerve you for ever, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of the cloſe-ſtool; and then making it clean for another time: for one Pill of dragm has the ſame effect, as the ordinary doſe of <hi>Vinum emeticum,</hi> and works as well, as if you took three or four of theſe Pills at a time.</p>
               <p>As for the mould of the Cup, it muſt be of ſand and can ſerve you but once: your Cup muſt be as thick as a Crown piece: you muſt make your addreſſes to thoſe that caſt Bells, to make you a mould: you may make one of Braſs, but it will coſt you too much, and yet will not do ſo well as one of ſand.</p>

You will ſee preſently, that your <hi>Faeces</hi> will curdle, become yellowiſh, and ſtink; your Curd being ſetled, pour away the Liquor, which you may keep to waſh your Bedſteds withal, to keep them clean from Punaiſes: then upon your Curds, throw common Water; and you ſhall ſee them precipitate into a powder of a Saffron-colour.

That the Acid, which you pour upon the ſaid <hi>Lexivium</hi> filtrated, produces three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects; of which the firſt is, To ſeparate the ſulphureous and ſaltiſh Smoot, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, and ſo it appears in Curds. The ſecond is, To give a groſs yellow colour to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106227:65"/> Curds and Water. The third is, To make the ſaid Curds and Water ſtink abominably. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the firſt effect; becauſe, that the Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sulphur, diſſolved by a ſaltiſh and lexivial diſſolvant, remains incorporated with him, till you pour in a little of a ſalinous Precipitant; which being of a different nature to the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, it happens that theſe two Salts, thus min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, begin to whet one another, and by their action, and re-action, cauſe an ebullition, evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and diſſipation of the ſharpeſt part of the diſſolvant. So that growing weak, he is forced to let go his hold, and ſuffer the body he had ſeized upon, to fall away to the bottom of the Veſſel. The Acid produces the ſecond effect; becauſe all Acids do enliven, and enlighten co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; now the colour of Sulphur is yellow, from whence it comes, that this Antimonial Sulphur, which in its diſſolution was of a dark yellow, in its precipitation, becomes now of a fine light yellow. Now all ſalinous Spirits, do vivifie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, becauſe, they are of a detergent nature, and do cleanſe, and take away all the greaſie, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſmoot, which did darken the luſtre of the natural colour, as linnen grows white and clean by bucking. The Acid produces the third effect; becauſe Sulphur, when it is heated, is naturally ſtinking; now it is heated by the action of the Precipitant, and re-action of the Diſſolvant: This may be obſerved in the hot waters of Mineral Baths, which ſtink extreamly of Sulphur; becauſe a bituminous and a ſulphureous ſpring, happening to joyn with a nitrous, and vitriolous ſpring,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106227:65"/> do whet, and heat one another, and ſo produce the ſulphureous ſmell.</p>

That if you pour a good quantity of common VVater upon theſe Curds, that preſently they are precipitated into a yellow powder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the ſaid VVater diſſolves all the Salts that remained in the ſaid Curds; ſo that then the Antimonial Sulphur, being free from all tyes and bonds, precipitates it ſelf into a powder of a much livelier colour, than that of the Curds: becauſe, now the Sulphur has thrown off the Salts, and appears under its own natural colour of Sulphur.</p>

Now in this Remedy we do pretend, that all that part of the Antimony which has been opened by the Niter, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deveſted of its purgative and emetick ſubſtance, that is, of all its volatil Salt, and Sulphur: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought not to uſe the Female Antimony, which has more of this volatil ſubſtance than the Male. But the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony is better; becauſe, as it is deveſted, as well of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of its volatil ſubſtance, as of its terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreity, it is fitter to be purified, and entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd from all its malignous qualities: and yet the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> is beſt of all; becauſe, in it the emetick Vertue is already fixed by <hi>Mars,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the Antimony.

That Niter is here uſed to open the body of Antimony, the Brimſtone is employed to fix its emetick quality; and the Brimſtone, if it were not joyned with Niter, would not be able to inflame the Antimony: for the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone being ſtifled in theſe veſſels, would preſently go out, but the Niter once a-fire, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtifled, yet ſets the other combuſtible bodies that are with it, a-fire alſo, till they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That the ſmoak and flowers of this Matter are red, becauſe of the Sulphur of the Antimony, which is redder than ordinary Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and ſo communicates its redneſs to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sulphur; it is not the Niter that gives this colour: for, we ſee that in the Diaphoretick An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, it whitens the Antimony.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That this Oyl of Antimony is of a blackiſh red, becauſe of the yellow tincture of Sulphur, mingled with the black tincture of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony: and this Oyl is acid, becauſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Sulphur and Antimony, which both are acid: for, as for the Spirits of Niter, they are all evaporated with the water, in which they were, and the Spirits of Sulphur remain to fix thoſe of Antimony.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106227:70"/> top, and then you muſt leave a gap to look through: fill your Retort quite full, if you will; for there is no danger of the matters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Retort in ſubſtance; and beſides, a gentle fire will preſently diſtill as much of it, as is deſired. Poſe your Retort upon a Round, in a ſmall wheel fire, and fit to it a Glaſs Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there will preſently riſe a white vapour, which being diſſolved, will diſtill in form of a whitiſh Oyl, call'd the Oyl of Antimony, and which in the Receiver, congeals to a kind of Butter.</p>
               <p>Take great care your fire be not too ſtrong, leſt your Mercury revived, ſhould come into the Receiver, and the Cinnaber of Antimony likewiſe, for that would render your powder yellow, which ought to be white: give then a moderate heat, till by the gap left in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, you perceive all your Matter to be melted into a lump, clear and tranſparent, like melted Silver; and then you may be ſure, that the Oily ſubſtance is diſtilled, therefore take off your Retort. This done, warm your Recipient ſo melt the Butter within it, which pour out immediately into a ſmall Glaſs Retort, unluted, and ſet it in the ſame Furnace, with the ſame degree of heat, fitting a Receiver, and ſo rectifie this oyl once, for to rectifie it twice, would be to diminiſh ſo much of its vertue, that in ſtead of ſeven grains for a Doſe, you would be forc'd to give fourteen. But obſerve, That if in either of theſe diſtillations any reviv'd Mercury ſhould be raiſed by too great a fire, and ſo come
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106227:70"/> into the Receiver: then ſeparate gently, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, the Oyl that ſwims on the top.</p>
               <p>This rectification being done, you muſt warm again your Receiver, ſo as to melt the Butter; and when it is melted, pour it preſently into a Glaſs Bell, full of cold water; the water will become as white as Milk, ſtir it a little, and your Butter will precipitate to the bottom, in form of a white powder: as ſoon as you perceive that, ſeparate by inclination this firſt water, which we call Pontick, that is, Sea-water, and is Mineral; for, you muſt not let this firſt water, lye long upon your Precipitate, leſt this water ſhould contract an aciditie, as great as that of Spirit of Vitriol, and ſo corrode, diſſolve, and diminiſh a good part of your Precipitate. The Water of this firſt Lotion, being poured off, pour on preſently as much again, and ſtir your Bell as you did before: then ſeparate by inclination, and continue ſo doing, till your powder be edulcorated, and your water come away inſipid: then filtrate the reſt in white Paper, as has been ſaid in the Chapter of the Diaphoretick Antimony. You ſhall have a very white powder, called the Emetick powder of Algarot; which keep in a glaſs, cloſe ſtopped.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the firſt diſtillation, in your luted Retort; if you have a mind to have the Cinnaber of Antimony, give a violent fire of entire ſuppreſſion, without any Receiver to your Retort; continue it, till your Retort be ſunk and almoſt melted. This fire will drive the Mercury to the end, and middle of the neck
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106227:71"/> of your Retort, and when the Operation is done, it will be either revived into Quick-ſilver, or turned into a gray blackiſh powder; there will alſo be driven to the mouth of the Retort, an Antimonial ſubſtance, which at the end of the Operation, will appear in form of a cruſt, as thick as the back of a Knife, and which outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is of a grey colour; but being pared, is within red, and is called Cinnaber of Antimony. Now in the bottom of this luted Retort, you will find a congealed lump, which is the reſt of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony revived: For, in this Operation, there riſes but a ſmall portion of your Antimony, to mingle with the corroſive Mercury, and there riſes a little more by the violence of the fire, to make this Cinnaber of Antimony; but the greateſt part remains in the Retort revived. Now to ſee theſe three ſubſtances together, after this violent fire, you muſt take off your Retort, let it cool, then ſhake the neck to make the Quick-ſilver fall out, whether revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or in a grey Powder; then break your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, to find in the neck the Cinnaber of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and in the bottom a lump of the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, melted and revived to its firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This done, weigh your Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and your Mercury, as well that which is revived, as that which is in powder, and you ſhall ſee, that all this will weigh a little more than the Corroſive ſublimate, which you have made uſe of in this Operation. Weigh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſaid Cinnaber of Antimony, and the lump of Antimony revived, and you'l ſee, that all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106227:71"/> this weighs a little leſs than the Antimony, which you have employed in this Operation; and that ſhews, that the ſaid Emetick powder comes partly from the Mercury, and partly from the Antimony.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That we uſe here corroſive, not dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Mercury; becauſe, the dulcified having loſt its corroſive Salts, would not be able to open the Antimony, and turn it into Oyl: and beſides, there would not reſult out of it an Emetick, becauſe Mercury does provoke vomit, but by its corroſive Salts.</p>

That we uſe here the beſt Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nay the beſt <hi>Regulus,</hi> becauſe, being well purified and ſeparated from its Sulphur, and its moſt malignant ſalts, there is produced of it a more gentle Emetick; and therefore it is better and whiter with the <hi>Regulus,</hi> than with the Male Antimony; but then, you will have no Cinnaber by augmenting your fire, but only there will ſtick a Mercurial Chryſtalline Salt to the ſides of the Retort.</p>

               <p>The vertue and uſe of the powder, is known by its name, which ſpeaks it to be a vomitive, and that it performs much more gently, than the <hi>Crocus metallorum;</hi> becauſe, the Antimony

That all your diſſolutions being put together, you muſt evaporate them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of three parts, and till there appear a ſaltiſh skin, or <hi>Pellicule</hi> upon the ſurface of the Liquor; elſe they would not congeal into Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals when cold. For, having too much flegm, that ſalt Spirit of the Vinegar, which hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Saturn, remains diſſolved its ſelf, in the flegm: but, when by a gentle ebullition, and evaporation of the ſaid flegm, the Salt Spirit remains alone, then it Chryſtaliſes eaſily in a cold place, ſince it begins to do it already in a hot one, as you ſee it does by its <hi>Pellicule.</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106227:77"/> of Saturn, made by a diſſolvant, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter their colour; and they are in taſte a little acid, and very ſweet, or ſugarins, acid, becauſe of the Vinegar: ſweet, becauſe that Lead, being the ſweeteſt of all Metals, has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very ſweet Salt, and thus the Salt of Lead is amongſt the Salts of Metals the ſame, that the Salt of the <hi>Indian</hi> Canes is almoſt the Salts of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.</p>

That when you pour two or three ſpoonfuls of Spirit of Sulphur upon your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, then this acid, being of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the acid of the Vinegar, fights with it, and weakens it ſo, as to make it loſe its hold, and ſo your Lead preſently curdles, and is precipitated into a white powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 11 That the Spirit of Sulphur is fitter for this precipitation, than any other acid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes whiter, ſweeter, and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, not only this, but all Magiſteries. The Spirit of Vitriol blacks; the Oyl of Tarter has an unpleaſant taſte of Urin; the Spirit of Salt would be apt to fix with this Magiſtery; and the Spirit of Niter is too ſharp.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 12: That the Cryſtals of <hi>Saturn</hi> are nothing but Lead, diſſolved and calcin'd Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically in diſtilled Vinegar, then coagulated into Cryſtals, by the evaporation of the flegm, and part of the ſharpeſt Spirits of the Vinegar, and ſo yet retaining a good part of the acid of the ſaid Vinegar. And as for the Magiſtery, it is likewiſe Lead diſſolved, and calcin'd by Vinegar, then eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, then precipitated into a white powder,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106227:77"/> by the Spirit of Sulphur, or ſome other acid, and at laſt, deveſted by lotions of the acid and ſharp part of the Vinegar, and the ſaid Spirit of Sulphur.</p>
               <p>The Uſe and Virtue of the diſſolution of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> before its evaporation into Cryſtals, or into the Magiſtery, is to cool, and appeaſe the pain, and and hardneſs of Inflamations; take away redneſs of the face, and <hi>Ereſipilae's;</hi> the affected part being waſhed with lint dip'd in it. This mixtion is of a milky colour; and therefore is called <hi>Virgina's</hi> milk. The Cryſtals and Magiſtery have the ſame vertue, to cool and appeaſe the pain, take away redneſs, ſoften hardneſs cauſed by inflamation, and attenuate and reſolve Tumours: for this purpoſe, you put five or ſix grains of them, and as much white Vitriol into a Glaſs of Roſe water, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin mingled, and then in it we dip a thin ſlice of raw Veal, and lay it upon your Eyes inflam'd, and full of pain, and redneſs. The ſame water may ſerve for the redneſs of the face, and <hi>Eriſipelas,</hi> dipping in it Linnen, and ſo applying it to the part affected: as for the oyl of <hi>Saturn,</hi> it may be mingled with ſome of your cooling unguents, as the <hi>Cerat</hi> of <hi>Gallen,</hi> or the <hi>unguentum roſatum,</hi> or <hi>Populeum,</hi> to mollifie, ſoften, and take away the redneſs of all inflamed parts; and, if you have not this Oyl, you make uſe of the Salt of <hi>Saturn</hi> in its place, for the ſame end.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That to make a good Infernal Stone either white, greyiſh, or black, you muſt uſe Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Silver; for, if you make it with Silver, where there is a mixtion of Copper, your Stone will be green, and ſoft, will eaſily melt of it ſelf; from whence you may conclude, that there is no making of it with Lead, or Tin, which yet are ſofter than Braſs; and as for Iron, it can never be diſſolved, and brought into a potable Liquor,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106227:81"/> becauſe of its great drineſs and terreſtreity.

Now when you make Lime-water, to ſerve to the making of the Phagedenick Water; there it is not neceſſary to ſlack your Lime ſo gently, becauſe it ſuffices, if you retain the fix'd Salt, that ſo it may be able to dry and conſume putrid Ulcers; but when you make the Lime-water to ſerve to the making of Cauteries, then you muſt ſtrive to keep in the Volatil Salt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Volatil Salt, that makes the fix'd Salt, of both Lime and Aſhes, to be fuſible: and therefore, if you will ſhape your Cauteries, and make them more Cauſtick, you muſt retain the volatil Salt.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106227:86"/> the luted conjunction of both the Veſſels: the true mark of a fit heat will be, if you can endure to lay your hand a pretty while upon the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this diſtillation is to laſt eighteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours without interruption; the Spirit, comes firſt alone, and in a Glaſs Receiver ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the form of white vapours: then the Oyl, with the reſt of the Spirits, comes forth in the ſame form alſo, and does diſſolve into a brown blackiſh liquor, which goes to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Receiver: for all Spirits, and all Oyls, do diſtil in forms of white vapours, except Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Niter, and <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> made with Niter, which therefore are called the flying Dragon, as well becauſe of their redneſs, as of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.

When all is cool, then unlute the Receiver, by wetting the lute with a wet cloath, and pour out your Oyl and Spirit of Guaiac together, into a glaſs Tunnel, and by one of theſe two ways, ſeparate the Spirit from the Oyl. Firſt, take a glaſs Tunnel, which hold with one hand, and with a finger of the ſame hand ſtop its lower orifice, then pour in your Liquor; the Oyl will preſently go to the bottom, the Spirit will ſwim above, and upon the ſurface of the Spirit will ſwim ſome black drops of Volatil Oyl of Guaiac: Then ſet a glaſs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al under the neck of your Tunnel, and let go half your finger which ſtops the ſaid orifice, and ſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106227:87"/> the Oyl will paſs into your Viol, and when you ſee that it is almoſt all paſſed, then ſtop the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice again with your finger, and pour the flegm or Spirit into another Vial. Do thus by all the ſpirit, and Oyl, you have in your Receiver, but by this way you will never ſeparate the Oyl from the flegm ſo well, but there will be ſome in it ſtill. Therefore uſe this ſecond method which will do it entirely and infallibly.</p>
               <p>Take a Coffin of brown Paper, wet it with common water, or with Spirit of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> if you have any, place it upon a Glaſs Tunnel, and pour into it the Oyl and the ſpirit together; the Spirit being watriſh will paſs, and filtrate through the ſaid Coffin of Paper, and the Oyl will remain; which afterwards you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey into another Vial, by breaking the bottom of your Paper Coffin with a little ſtick; if you do not wet throughly the ſaid Coffin of Paper before you pour into it the Oyl and Spirit, the Oyl will ſtick to the Paper, and hinder the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the flegm: If your Oyl do not come kindly out of your Receiver, becauſe it may be it is cold, and ſo condenſed; preſent your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver to the fire to diſſolve; your Oyl will be black and ſtinking, as the Oyl of Jet, and your ſpirit will be of a brown colour. Out of one pound of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> you'l draw about one ounce and a half of Oyl, and ten ounces of Spirit: and there will remain about four ounces of Coals in your Retort: you may kindle this Coal, and burn it to aſhes, and of theſe aſhes make a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and out of this <hi>Lixivium</hi> draw

               <p>To make the Extract of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> put ſome Oyl of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> to evaporate and thicken into the form of an Extract, into a Cup or a Sand-fire or elſe draw the tincture of the Oyl of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> with Spirit of Wine, and ſo evaporate it to the conſiſtence of an Extract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That for this Diſtillation, we uſe a ſtone Retort, becauſe it is not neceſſary to uſe a glaſs one, which would be dearer, and the Spirit is not corroſive enough to corrode this Stone-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as the Spirits of Niter, Salt, or Vitriol would do; beſides, that the necks of your glaſs Retorts are ſo narrow, that the chips of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> can hardly be got into them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That <hi>Guaiacum</hi> yields a good deal of Oyl and Spirit, becauſe it is full of Sulphur, and Mercury; the Wood yields better than the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106227:88"/> Bark, and the Wood in little pieces, yields more than in ſhavings, or great cuts; for, by their thickneſs, they retain more of Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. This Oyl and Spirit are very Salt, and therefore the Wood is heavie, for the Salts give the heavineſs to Mixtes. The Oyl is black and foetid, becauſe it has been diſtilled in a naked Fire, without any <hi>intermedium;</hi> and it is heavie, becauſe of its Salt; as alſo ſharp, for the ſame reaſon. The Heart of the Wood yields more Oyl, than that part which is near the Bark; which you may perceive by the eye, for the heart is blackiſh, and the other is yellowiſh, like Box, which is the <hi>European Guaiacum.</hi>

                  <hi>Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Vertues:</hi> The Spirit is ſomewhat drying and deterſive; it is excellent for Burnings and old Ulcers, waſhing them with ſome Lint dipped in it; beſides, if you put five or ſix drops of it in a bottle of Sudorifick Decoction, it will work a greater effect, than if there were a great quantity of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> in the ſaid Decoction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, this Spirit has the force of the <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> and beſides, much more activity, and penetration, by the tenuity of its Spirituous ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The Oyl of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> is very drying, deterſive, and cleanſing; it therefore cures rarely well old putrid hard Ulcers, the Gangrene, and the Caries, or Rot of the Bones.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106227:103"/> we do not need the volatil Salt, as we do in our Cauteries; it is enough here, that the Water be impregnated with the fixt Salt of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, to be fit to cleanſe and dry Ulcers.</p>

Therefore it is but trifling to make two or three Lime waters one after another upon the ſame Lime.</p>
               <p>To make the Phagedenick water; put two pound of the ſaid Quick-lime Water into a Glaſs Bell, or an Earthen white Ware Pan, and put to it, from half a dragm to a dragm, of Corroſive Sublimate well powdered, (in an Earthen white Ware Diſh with an Earthen Peſtle.) This Water, and the Sublimate, after the firſt ſtirring of them together, will become preſently of an Orange colour, the Sublimate will go to the bottom, and is called the Orange-Sublimate. If you have a deſire to make your Phagedenick Water weaker, pour upon it two pounds more of Lime Water; then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

That the Sublimate from white becomes yellow or orange colour, when mixt with the Lime water, becauſe that thoſe Sulphureous Salts, of which the Corroſive Sublimate is not deveſted, being to engage with the Salt of the Lime, are quickened, and ſo revive their colour in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, ſo much as to communicate their tincture to the VVater and Sublimate.</p>

               <p>Put freſh Juniper Berries into a Braſs Veſica, till it be half full, fill one third more of the Veſica with common cold water, let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe twenty four hours in the Veſica, with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fire, to extract afterwards the better the oyly Eſſence of your Berries, having all this while ſtopt the mouth of your Veſica with a Linnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth; take out this cloth, and fit to your Braſs body its Mores-head, border'd with a refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and a moveable Pipe, and do as has been taught in the diſtillation of the waters of Plants; that which will firſt come, will be the Aromatick, Balſamick Eſſence, or Oyl of Juniper Bays, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a little flegm, or inflegmated Spirit; and then the reſt of the flegm will follow. Out of a peck of Berries, you will not have above two ounces of Eſſence, or Oyl, all the reſt will be flegm, or Spirit inflegmatized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That becauſe we can draw but a very ſmall quantity of Oyl or Eſſence, not only out of Juniper Berries, but alſo out of all Balſamick and Aromatick Leaves, Flowers, Rinds, Barks, Roots, Woods, Berries, and Seeds, therefore we have found the way of uſing Spirit of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, ſeparated by three or four Rectifications from its red Oyl, putting three or four ounces upon every peck of Berries; to the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated with the Eſſence of Juniper, it may augment, and encreaſe the quantity of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106227:111"/> ſaid Eſſence, and yet not change its qualities; but if you ſhould put more than three or four ounces of this Spirit on a peck of Berries, the ſmell of the Turpentine would predominate, and ſo ſpoil your Eſſence: thus the Provenſals prepare and multiply their Eſſences, and by affording them cheap, make them become common. But I could wiſh that they would leave off ſophiſticating them, and ſell them as dear as they ſtand them in, and are really worth; particularly, thoſe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences that are to be taken inwardly; but the covetouſneſs of thoſe that ſell, and the ſparing way of the buyers, will never give way to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That when you have put to your Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Spirit of Turpentine well rectified; the firſt liquor that comes is the ſaid Spirit impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the oyly Eſſence of your Juniper Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That there are two ways to ſeparate the oyly Eſſence from its flegm. The firſt, is by a glaſs Tunnel or a Coffin of brown Paper wet before hand with common water; or with the Spirit of your Berries, as it has been ſaid before: only obſerve, that moſt of the Eſſences do ſwim upon their flegm, and therefore, that in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them by the glaſs Tunnel, the firſt thing that runs out, muſt be the flegm; and by the Coffin, 'tis alſo the flegm that goes through; the Oyl remains; which you draw out by making a hole in your Paper Coffin towards the bottom, and holding a glaſs Vial under to receive your Oyl.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:106227:111"/>
               <p> The ſecond way is, to put into a glaſs Matraſs, with a ſhort neck, all the flegm with which the Oyl is diſtilled; and then make a rowl of Cotton like the Wick of a Candle; of which put one end into your Matraſs, to make it touch the ſaid Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and let the other end hang into a glaſs Vial, tied with a pack-thred to the neck of the Matraſs: your Eſſence will by little and little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe the Cotton, and at laſt run quite through it, till it come out at the other end, and fall by drops into your Vial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That the Balſamick, and Aromatick Eſſence, or Oyl of Juniper, as of all other Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks, and Aromaticks, is nothing but the ſubtleſt part of its Sulphur and Volatil Salt, becauſe of its Sulphur it retains the ſmell of the Berries, and the yellow colour of their Tincture, and becauſe of its volatil Salt, it retains the taſte, and <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the ſaid Berries; in theſe two, the Salt and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, conſiſts the excellence of this ſimple; but, becauſe the Oyl of Juniper has but little Salt, therefore it ſwims upon its flegm, and having been drawn by common water, it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the natural ſmell, ſavour, and tincture of the Berries; and thus it happens to all drogues of this nature: for, if you diſtil them in a naked fire without water, there will come from them a ſtinking cauſtick Oyl, as we have taught in the Chapter of the diſtillation of the ſtinking Oyl of Cloves. But before this ſtinking Oyl, we do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily draw from Aromatick drogues by the <hi>intermedium</hi> of water, all their Eſſence and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Oyl, which is a kind of Virgin Oyl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106227:112"/> the pureſt part of them. After its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there remains yet in the <hi>Faeces</hi> a thick groſs terreſtrial ſaltiſh Oyl, which we draw without <hi>intermedium</hi> by diſtillation <hi>ad latus</hi> in a glaſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort luted in a naked fire: and becauſe this Oyl is drawn without <hi>intermedium</hi> in a naked fire, and by the combuſtion and flagration of the ſaid Drugs, therefore it is black and ſtinking, and of an ill taſte, and much more cauſtick than the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick Oyl, which contains leſs of the Volatil Salt, the flegm having ſhared a good part of the ſaid Salt, with the Oyl; but in the foetid Oyl, the Volatil Salt is as it were ſhut in, and not carried away by its flegm, whereof it has very little.</p>
               <p>If you rectifie your Eſſence of Juniper in a little glaſs Retort in a Sand-fire, there will come off a Spirit, which is the Spirit of Turpentine, which you had added to it, and there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Retort a pure Eſſence of Juniper as yellow as Gold, and as thick as true Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam.</p>

That all thoſe preparations practiſed upon Opium ordinarily, do rather cleanſe it, and purifie it from its <hi>Faeces,</hi> than free it from any venomous ſubſtance, or malignous quality; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you take of that Opium which is in little even Cakes, neatly environed with Leaves; you may give it without any other preparation at all, only beat it warm in a Mortar, and ſo form Pills of it.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That in the belief that moſt have, that the thin Volatil ſubſtance of Opium, is that which cauſes its malignity, they have ſtudied all ways imaginable whereby to deveſt it of this Volatil ſubſtance; as by drying it over the fire, and ſo cauſing this Sulphureous ſubtile ſubſtance to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106227:115"/> but it is not againſt reaſon to believe, that in this exſiccation, or drying, the flegm alone, which is innocent enough, is the thing exhal'd, and that Opium in its whole ſubſtance is of a ſubtle, Volatil, Narcotick nature, and in that conſiſts its Malignity.</p>

That we uſe Spirit of Wine for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvant, becauſe it draws much more perfectly this Tincture than any other liquor would, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Opium is of a thick, glutinous, juicy nature, and Spirit of Wine is the beſt Diſſolver of all Gums: beſides, the deſign being to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb the ſenſes, the Spirit of Wine, which has the ſame faculty, is moſt proper, and being a cordial, is a rare corrective of that malignity which we ſuppoſe in Opium. Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that diſtilled Vinegar would be a fitter menſtruum, becauſe they pretend by it to fix a little the Volatil nature of the Opium, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fumes which make it to ariſe to the head. To which I anſwer, with this diſtinction, That if the deſign be to appeaſe the Head-ach, and correct <hi>Inſomniums,</hi> then <hi>Laudanum</hi> prepared with Spirit of Wine is beſt; but if it be to ſtop a Diarrhaea, or Dyſentery, or aſſwage the pains of the Colick, then <hi>Laudanum</hi> prepared with Vinegar is fitteſt; becauſe the Spirit of Wine carries one to the Head, and the Vinegar keeps the other down in the Belly: but we muſt have one of theſe menſtruums, if we will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Tincture of Opium well: for pure Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar ſmells too much of Vinegar; common Water is not ſtrong enough, becauſe of the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſity

That if your Opium be very clean, and without Ordure, it will turn almoſt all of it into Tincture, and leave but very few <hi>Faeces;</hi> and ſo the extract of Opium is but a purified Opium, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all mixture of other things, and deveſted of ſome of its own indiſſolvable terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreity.</p>

Saffron, Pearls, Corral, Treacle, Musk, Ambergreaſe, and other ingredients which are added, ſerving for nothing but to take up more room, and often are quite oppoſite and contrary to the deſign intended by giving Opium, ſo far they are from augmenting the vertue of it.</p>

               <p>TAke four ounces of Flowers of Brimſtone, and ſixteen ounces of common Salt decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated and powdered, mingle them well together: which, that you may the better do, put a ſpoonful of each at a time upon a Marble ſtone, and there grind them to an impalpable powder; wet this powder drop by drop with diſtilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, till you have reduced all into the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Pap, or haſty Pudding, then ſcrape it together with a piece of Horn, and continue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, till all your matter be grown'd, and thus prepared: in the mean time, boil ſix pound or three quarts of common water, in a Braſs Kettle, and when the water boils, throw in all this lump of Matter, and after it has boil'd a little, add to it half an ounce of white Roch-Alom in powder, and ſtir it with a Woodden <hi>Spatula,</hi> keeping your Kettle on the fire, till all be diſſolved in the water, which then will be of red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh muddy colour; and this will happen in half an hours time, then take off the Kettle, let your diſſolution cool; in cooling, the Brimſtone will precipitate to the bottom in a whitiſh colour:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106227:117"/> when it is all precipitated, pour off gently the Water, which will be impregnated with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt and Alom: pour common Water upon your whitiſh Matter to ſweeten it, and do ſo till the Water come away inſipid, and that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be entirely freed from the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the Vinegar, Alom, and common Salt: filtrate that which remains through a Coffin of white Paper, or through a glaſs Tunnel, as has been taught heretofore; and you have the Precipitate or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery of Brimſtone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That our deſign being here to open and whiten the body of Brimſtone, we uſe the Flowers of Brimſtone; becauſe, that by reaſon of their impalpability, which they have contracted in their ſublimation, they are fitter to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with common Salt, and to become whiter than common Brimſtone would be, which would be very hard to be powdered ſo fine, as the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Brimſtone are already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we uſe common Salt, to open, calcine, and whiten the body of Brimſtone, and we uſe it decrepitated, and three times as much in quantity as the flowers of Brimſtone, to the end it may do its work the better: for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of which we alſo add diſtilled Vinegar, which quickens the common Salt, by incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with the Sulphur.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That for this incorporation we uſe not a Braſs Mortar, becauſe it might black the powder by the attraction of the Tincture of the Metal, but we uſe a Marble and Stone one, where the fineſt things may be eaſily made
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106227:118"/> finer, ſo that a hair might be broken upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That Brimſtone alone would never diſſolve in water, though never ſo exactly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, becauſe that being exteriourly of a greaſie, oleaginous nature, and its Salt being altogether buried in its own ſubſtance, all the ways of being diſſolv'd are taken away from it. But if you add to it common Salt, by means of the diſtilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and the Levigation of it, then all being one body, it happens that the Salt and Vinegar in their diſſolution do engage the Brimſtone to diſſolve at the ſame time; but then it is neceſſary that your water ſhould boil ſome time, to haſten the diſſolution of theſe bodies, and ſo the Sulphur being a little opened, and calcin'd by the common Salt and Vinegar, does at laſt afford its Tincture to the ſaid water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. During the ebullition of the common Salt and Brimſtone in the common water, we add a little Alom to whiten and ſcowre the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, for Alom is a very dry white Salt, and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone quite contrary, is a very oyly mucilaginous one; we do not uſe <hi>Roman</hi> Alom, becauſe that it is red, and would communicate its colour to the Magiſtery of Brimſtone, which ought to be white by reaſon of the common Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. That the Brimſtone is precipitated all alone without any Precipitant, as ſoon as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grows cold, becauſe its diſſolution in water was not perfect, and the ſtrength of the Salts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dulled by the coldneſs of the water, they can no longer retain the Brimſtone above water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 7. That the Precipitate, or Magiſtery of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106227:118"/> Brimſtone, is but Brimſtone Philoſophically cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd by common Salt, and diſtilled Vinegar, and ſcoured by Alom, then ſweetened by waſhings, and ſo whitened in form of a powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Vertues:</hi> 'Tis an excellent dryer, or diſſicative for all Ulcers, and therefore is fitter to make the Balſam of Brimſtone, either with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Turpentine, or with Walnut-Oyl, than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Brimſtone, or the Flowers of Brimſtone: It is particularly good againſt all Ulcers of the Lungs, to ripen the Fluxions that fall from the Breaſt, and help the Expectoration of Flegms, and alſo to dry away the humours which flow that way. It may be taken either in a ſpoonful of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, or in ſome Conſerve, or you powder with it a Toaſt ſpread with freſh Butter, or Oyl. The Doſis is, from half a dragm to a dragm. And if at the ſame time you will ſtrengthen the Stomach, and gently looſen the Belly, you add half a dragm of Rhubarb in powder upon your Toaſt, you may put it into a ſpoonful of ſome pectoral Water; but it is not ſo eaſie this way, becauſe, by its lightneſs, it ſwims upon the Water; and that ſo, in ſtead of ſwallowing it, a good deal will remain in your mouth. You may likewiſe uſe it in a <hi>Pomatum,</hi> againſt the Itch and Scabs, becauſe that this Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone hath acquired not only a ſingular whiteneſs, but has alſo loſt all its ill ſmell, which makes all the Unguents and Balſams of Sulphur ſo ſtinking and unpleaſant: but it would be a dear Unguent, becauſe you can hardly prepare much of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery at once, nor without great pains and coſt.</p>

After you have poured out the laſt Water, your matter will remain like Pap; which put into a paper Coffin, and there let it dry in the ſhade upon a Sieve; you will have the Magiſtery of Pearls, as white as Snow, in little miſ-ſhapen pieces, which

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That we reduce the Pearls to a fine powder, that they may be eaſilier diſſolved, by a leſs quantity of Diſſolvant; in the powdering of them, the Mortar is covered, becauſe, that Pearls being ſmall, and round, and hard, would in beating, be apt to leap out of the Mortar, and be loſt, if it were not covered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we rather uſe here Spirit of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, than diſtill'd Vinegar, or juice of Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; becauſe it diſſolves them eaſilier than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the other, inſomuch, that one pound of Spirit of Sulphur, will ſooner diſſolve an ounce of Pearls, than twelve pound of diſtill'd Vinegar, or juice of Lemmons; beſides, that the Spirit of Sulphur is more cordial and pectoral than either of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That the Spirits of Salt, Niter, and Vitriol, are not proper for this Operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their too great corroſive faculties, which would go near to reſt in the Magiſtery, and then we ſhould be obliged to ſweeten it ſo long, till at laſt the Water of the Lotion would carry away with it a good part of the Magiſtery. We may ſay as much of the Oyl of Tartar, made <hi>per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi> in a wet place, or by the diſſolution of the Salt of Tartar in common Water; beſides, the Spirit of Vitriol would black the whiteneſs of the Magiſtery, and the Oyl of Tartar would make it rough to the feeling.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That common Water is ſufficient to precipitate the ſaid Magiſtery, and weaken the Spirit of Sulphur, ſo as to make it loſe its hold: becauſe that the diſſolution of Pearls by the ſaid Spirit, having been performed without the help of an external heat, and without any great pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, there is no need of any ſtrong fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Diſſolvant, and the Precipitant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. That the Water of the firſt ſweetning, has a little ſmell of Ambergreece, if the diſſolution be with the Spirit of Sulphur: for, Pearls open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Spirit, have ſuch a ſmell.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106227:124"/> your Water be half conſumed away; filter the ſaid diſſolution, while it is warm, through a cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin of brown Paper: evaporate your filtration by a good fire, either in the ſame Kettle, or in an earthen-glaz'd Pan, till there remain nothing but a powder, as white as flower, in the bottom of the Veſſel; taking care to ſtir the ſaid powder with an iron <hi>Spatula,</hi> leſt by ſo great a fire it ſhould melt again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we calcine firſt the Cryſtal in a great reverberatory fire, till it be melted, to the end we may ſo open it, as to be able to reduce it to an impalpable powder, and ſo make it fit to be calcined by the Niter.</p>

That we calcine a ſecond time the ſaid Cryſtal with fine Niter, to open its body better, and ſo the Niter may communicate to it its fix'd Salt, and that of the body of the Cryſtal, and of the body of the fix'd Salt of Niter, there reſult one body, and one Calx.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. That this Salt of Cryſtal, is nothing but Cryſtal incorporated with the fix'd Salt of Niter; ſo that it is more properly a Calx, than a pure Salt. The Cryſtal communicates nothing but its Virginal Earth, and the Niter, nothing but its fixt Salt; and therefore, Cryſtal containing in its
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106227:124"/> ſelf no Salt at all, this Remedy ought more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to be called <hi>Cryſtal niter'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cryſtal is a clear tranſparent Glaſs, and Glaſs is a Cryſtal leſs clear, and tranſparent; the only ſubject matter of both of them made by Art, is a congealed Virginal Earth, hardened under the form of Pibble Stones, and Cryſtalline River Sand. This matter cannot be melted, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, but by the Salts both of Vegetables and Minerals; and after the fuſion, and vitrification of the ſaid Sand, and Pibble Stones, all the Salt is ſeparated, and comes away from it, ſo as there remains not any in either Glaſs, or Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal.</p>

In this Operation Benjamin loſes its red colour, and acquires a very white one, becauſe that of what colour ſoever the body that is converted into flowers be, the flowers ſtill muſt be white; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it is their volatil Salt which predominates over them, and which by conſequent muſt inveſt them with that colour which is natural to all, and particularly to volatil Salts.

That we uſe here a glazed Pan, as well becauſe that Brimſtone has not force enough to corrode the glazing, as becauſe that being gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, the Pans are ſmoother, and ſo it is eaſier to ſcrape off your Flowers: a ſtone Cucurbit would break, and you would hardly ſcrape off all your Flowers in a ſtone Pan, whoſe ſurface is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106227:131"/> with a woodden <hi>Spatula;</hi> then take off your Kettle from the fire, and filter your Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion while it is warm, through divers Coffins of brown Paper; evaporate your filtrations in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then glaz'd Pans, over a naked fire, till by their boyling, there appear a kind of a skin upon the ſurface of the ſaid Decoction: then take off your Pans, place them in your Cellar, and in three or four days there will be congealed to the bottom and ſides of your Pans, great quantity of Cryſtals as white as Snow, and of a triangular and ſquare Figure Pour out the Water that remains in your Pans, if it look dirty, keep it, and boyl it again to a conſiſtence of a skin, then congeal it in your Cellar, and ſo draw out all the Cryſtals left in it; dry your Cryſtals either in the Sun, or in a dry place; then gather them, and put them into glaſs Vials well ſtop'd: and thus you have that which Chymiſts call <hi>Cremor Tartari,</hi> or Cryſtal of Tartar. Out of one pound of Tartar, you have foor ounces of Cryſtals, and twelve of <hi>Faeces.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That for this Operation, we chuſe Tartar of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> becauſe, it is much ſalter than the Tartar of any other part of <hi>France;</hi> becauſe, that at <hi>Montpellier</hi> they uſe great Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, or rather Tuns, that ſerve twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, ſo that there gather to the ſides of them, a Tartar three or four fingers thick, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent very ſaltiſh; beſides that, the ſtrength of the Wine of thoſe parts, makes their Tartar bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and at laſt we chuſe white Tartar, becauſe it contains more Salt than the red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That we waſh well the lumps of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106227:131"/> before we powder them, to the end, we may cleanſe them from a kind of terreſtrial dreggs, which remain upon the ſaid Tartar, in form of a powder: by waſhing, part of this powder goes to the bottom, and part of it makes the Water look muddy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That we powder and ſearce it, that we may extract eaſilier, and more abundantly, the ſaid Cryſtal of Tartar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That we boyl it in a great quantity of Water, and that a good while, that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract all its ſaltiſh ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. That it is thrown in by ſpoonfuls, and not altogether, that ſo the diſſolution of its Salt be the better performed, and ſooner; and for the ſame reaſon the Water is not cold, but boyling hot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. That we ſtir it continually with a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi> elſe it would remain in the bottom of the Kettle, in a lump, and ſo being touched by the Water, but on one ſide, it would not ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. Now your <hi>Spatula</hi> muſt be of Wood, and not of Iron, leſt the blackneſs of the Iron, by the acidity of the Tartar, come off, and ſpoil the beauty of your Cryſtals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 7. That we boyl our Tartar with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in Braſs or Copper Kettles, and in earthen Pans, becauſe that the Salt of Tartar is not ſharp enough to corrode Braſs, Copper, or the glazing of Lead; and therefore, there is no danger it ſhould be loaden, or impregnated with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and particularly, if it be uncalcin'd Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and diſſolved in Water.</p>

That your Tartar having ſufficiently boyl'd in Water, and the Water being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all its Salt, we filter this diſſolution through a brown Paper-coffin, that ſo we may ſeparate all the terreſtrial indiſſolvable part of it, which will remain in the Coffin of brown Paper; this filtration is performed while the Diſſolution is warm, that ſo the Salt may paſs with it, which would go to the bottom, in form of a white pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the Diſſolution were cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 9. That to cryſtallize the Salt of Tartar uncalcin'd, and diſſolv'd in Water, you muſt eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate above half of your Water, till your Salt begin to coagulate; which you obſerve, by that little skin, that gathers upon the ſurface of your Water; then by taking off your Veſſels, and placing them in a cold place, as the Cellar, the Salt is formed into Cryſtals, and is freed from the Water, which kept it in diſſolution. If you had continued your evaporation, till your matter had been dry, there would have remained in the bottom of your Veſſel, a white Salt in powder, but it is much more pleaſant, to have it in the form of Cryſtals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 10. That the Cryſtal of Tartar, or <hi>Cremor Tartari,</hi> is nothing but Tartar ſcoured, and whitened by Lotion, pulveriſation, boyling in the Water, filtration, evaporation, and coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or cryſtallization made in the Cellar. It is compoſed of two ſubſtances; one is ſaltiſh, the other is terreſtrial: The firſt, diſſolves in any Water; the ſecond, only in warm Water: and as ſoon as the Water is cold the Cryſtal frees its
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106227:132"/> ſelf from it, and coagulates in the bottom, in form of a white powder, if there be a good deal of Water; but, if there be but a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, it coagulates into white Cryſtals, ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Vertues:</hi> It is a great Aperitive, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopilative, and Diuretick.

The Doſe is, from half a dragm, to two, taken inwardly in broth: It is often min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Opiates, and alſo with purgative Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, then you muſt ſwallow them more than luke-warm, elſe it would coagulate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the bottom of the Cup, or Glaſs: ſome alſo do diſſolve of it in Clyſters, to the weight of two dragms, or half an ounce.</p>

The Doſe is, ſix or eight drops in ſome Broth, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Water: and for the Teeth, you may put a ſpoonful of it in two ſpoonfuls of Roſe-Water, or Flower of Orange, or Jaſmin. It has likewiſe the vertue of preſerving your Wine in your Cellar for many years, by putting about half a pound of this Potable Gold into a Hogſhead of Wine; but except it be very rare Wine indeed, and that you deſire to have it of many years, it would coſt you more than it would be worth.</p>
